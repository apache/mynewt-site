The\nnewt command line tool and the entire build toolchain is available in a single\ndocker container. The container is all that's needed to run your Mynewt based\napplication in the simulator.  Enabling USB2 with your docker installation will\nallow you to load your application on a supported device.\n\n\nDocker is the only supported option if you are working on a Windows machine. If you are using Mac OS X or Linux, you have the choice of installing a Docker container of tools and toolchains or installing them natively. This chapter describes how to set up the Docker image for all three platforms.\n\n\n\n\nInstall Docker\n\n\nInstall docker for your platform. \nMac OS X\n / \nWindows\n / \nLinux\n\n\nMac and Windows\n\n\nMac and Windows require Docker Toolbox to interact with USB devices.  Docker\nfor Mac and Docker for Windows do not support USB. Docker Toolbox uses\nVirtualBox and allows you to map USB devices into docker containers as\ndescribed below.\n\n\nMake sure to double click the Docker Quickstart Terminal application if you're\non Mac or Windows.\n\n\nLinux\n\n\nThe docker daemon listens on a Unix domain socket on Linux.  That socket is\nowned by root, which means by default you must be root to start a container.\nMake sure to follow the optional step of adding yourself to the docker group so\nyou can start the newt container as yourself.\n\n\n\n\nUse the newt wrapper script\n\n\nUse the newt wrapper script to invoke newt.

Install Go, the programming language\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGo language environment dictates a directory structure.

To setup this workspace environment, create a 'dev' directory and then a 'go' directory under it. Set the GOPATH environment variable to this directory where you will soon clone the \nnewt\n tool repository.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        $ cd $HOME\n        $ mkdir -p dev/go  \n        $ cd dev/go\n        $ export GOPATH=`pwd`\n\n\n\n\n\n(Note that you need to add export statements to ~/.bash_profile to export variables permanently.

When installed, Go offers you as a developer a language environment (to compile Go code), construct Go packages (to assemble Go packages) and import Go code (from github). In the next step, you will use the Go commands to import \nnewt\n repo into your local Go environment.\n\n\n\n\n        $ brew install go\n        ==\n \n        ...\n        ... \n        ==\n *Summary*\n        \ud83c\udf7a  /usr/local/Cellar/go/1.5.1: 5330 files, 273M\n\n\n\n\n\nAlternatively, you can download the Go package directly from (https://golang.org/dl/) instead of brewing it. Install it in /usr/local directory.\n\n\n\n\n3. Create local repository\n\n\n\n\nUse Go commands to copy the directory (currently the ASF incubator directory). Be patient as it may take a minute or two. Check the directories installed.\n\n\n\n\n        $ go get mynewt.apache.org/newt/...\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCheck that newt.go is in place.\n\n\n\n\n        $ ls $GOPATH/src/mynewt.apache.org/newt\n        DISCLAIMER  NOTICE      newt        newtvm      viper\n        LICENSE     README.md   newtmgr     util        yaml\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4. Build the Newt tool\n\n\n\n\nUse Go to run the newt.go program to build the \nnewt\n tool. The command \ngo install\n compiles and writes the resulting executable to an output file named \nnewt\n, which is then installed, along with its dependencies, in $GOPATH/bin.\n\n\n\n\n        $ cd $GOPATH/src/mynewt.apache.org/newt/newt\n        $ go install\n        $ ls \n$GOPATH\n/bin/\n        newt newtmgr newtvm\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAt this point, you can try using \nnewt\n. For example, check for the version number by typing 'newt version'. See all the possible commands available to a user of newt by typing 'newt -h'.\n\n\n\n\n(Note: If you are going to be modifying the \nnewt\n often and going to be compile the program every time you call it, you will want to store the command in a variable in your .bash_profile. So type in \nexport newt=\"go run $GOPATH/mynewt.apache.org/newt/newt/newt.go\"\n in your .bash_profile and execute it by calling \n$newt\n at the prompt instead of \nnewt\n. Essentially, \n$newt\n calls \ngo run\n which runs the compiled binary directly without producing an executable. Don't forget to reload the updated bash profile by typing \nsource ~/.bash_profile\n at the prompt! )\n\n\n        $ newt version\n        Newt version:  1.0\n        $ newt -h\n        Newt allows you to create your own embedded project based on the Mynewt\n        operating system.

Once built using the \nnewt\n tool, this application will blink the LED lights on the target board.\n\n\nThis tutorial describes how to run Mynewt OS on Arduino Zero. Follow these simple steps and your board will be blinking in no time!\n\n\nPrerequisites\n\n\nBefore tackling this tutorial, it's best to read about Mynewt in the \nIntroduction\n section of this documentation.\n\n\nEquipment\n\n\nYou will need the following equipment\n\n\n\n\nAn Arduino Zero board.  NOTE: There are many flavors of Arduino. Ensure that \nyou have an Arduino Zero. See below for the versions of Arduino Zero that are\ncompatible with this tutorial\n\n\nA computer that can connect to the Arduino Zero over USB\n\n\nA USB cable (Type A to micro B) that can connect the computer to the Arduino\n\n\nThe Mynewt Release\n\n\n\n\nThis tutorial has been tested on the following three Arduino Zero boards - Zero, M0 Pro, and Zero-Pro.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMynewt has not been tested on Arduino M0 which has no internal debugger support.\n\n\nInstall Mynewt and Newt\n\n\n\n\nIf you have not already done so, install Newt as shown in the \nNewt install tutorial\n\n\nIf you have not already done so, create a project as shown in the Quick Start guide on how to \nCreate Your First Project\n. Skip the testing and building the project steps in that tutorial since you will be defining a target for your Arduino board in this tutorial.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFetch External Packages\n\n\nMynewt uses source code provided directly from the chip manufacturer for \nlow level operations. Sometimes this code is licensed only for the specific manufacturer of the chipset and cannot live in the Apache Mynewt repository. That happens to be the case for the Arduino Zero board which uses Atmel SAMD21. Runtime's github repository hosts such external third-party packages and the Newt tool can fetch them.\n\n\nTo fetch the package with MCU support for Atmel SAMD21 for Arduino Zero from the Runtime git repository, you need to add \nthe repository to the \nproject.yml\n file in your base project directory.\n\n\nHere is an example \nproject.yml\n file with the Arduino Zero repository\nadded. The sections with \nmynewt_arduino_zero\n that need to be added to \nyour project file are highlighted.\n\n\n$ more project.yml \nproject.name: \nmy_project\n\n\nproject.repositories:\n    - apache-mynewt-core\n\n    - mynewt_arduino_zero\n\n\nrepository.apache-mynewt-core:\n    type: github\n    vers: 0-latest\n    user: apache\n    repo: incubator-mynewt-core\n\n\nrepository.mynewt_arduino_zero:\n\n    type: github\n\n    vers: 0-latest\n\n    user: runtimeinc\n\n    repo: mynewt_arduino_zero\n\n$ \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOnce you've edited your \nproject.yml\n file, the next step is to install the \nproject dependencies, this can be done with the \nnewt install\n command \n(to see more output, provide the \n-v\n verbose option.): \n\n\n$ newt install \napache-mynewt-core\nmynewt_arduino_zero\n$\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNOTE:\n If there has been a new release of a repo used in your project since you last installed it, the \n0-latest\n version for the repo in the \nproject.yml\n file will refer to the new release and will not match the installed files. In that case you will get an error message saying so and you will need to run \nnewt upgrade\n to overwrite the existing files with the latest codebase.\n\n\n\n\nCreate your bootloader target\n\n\nNext, you need to tell Newt what to build.  For the Arduino Zero, we are going to \ngenerate both a bootloader, and an image target.\n\n\nTo generate the bootloader target, you need to specify the following options. The output of the commands (indicating success) have been suppressed for easier readability. \n\n\n$ newt target create arduino_boot \n$ newt target set arduino_boot bsp=@mynewt_arduino_zero/hw/bsp/arduino_zero \n$ newt target set arduino_boot app=@apache-mynewt-core/apps/boot \n$ newt target set arduino_boot build_profile=optimized\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you have an Arduino Zero Pro or M0 Pro, you have to set the following next:\n\n\n$ newt target set arduino_boot features=arduino_zero_pro \n\n\n\n\n\nIf you have an Arduino Zero, you have to set the following instead:\n\n\n$ newt target set arduino_boot features=arduino_zero \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThese commands do a few things: \n\n\n\n\nCreate a target named \narduino_boot\n, in order to build the Arduino Zero Bootloader.\n\n\nSet the application for the \narduino_boot\n target to the default Apache Mynewt \n    bootloader (\n@apache-mynewt-core/apps/boot\n)\n\n\nSet the board support package for the target to \n    \n@mynewt_arduino_zero/hw/bsp/arduino_zero\n.  This is a reference to the downloaded \n    Arduino Zero support from Github.\n\n\nUse the \"optimized\" build profile for the \narduino_boot\n target.  This\n    instructs Newt to generate smaller and more efficient code for this target.\n    This setting is necessary due to the bootloader's strict size constraints.\n\n\nTells the Board Support Package to enable support for the Arduino Zero Pro or the Arduino Zero. Set it to \narduino_zero\n or \narduino_zero_pro\n depending on the board you have.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBuild your bootloader\n\n\nOnce you've configured the bootloader target, the next step is to build the bootloader for your Arduino. You can do this by using the \nnewt build\n command:\n\n\n$ newt build arduino_boot \nCompiling asprintf.c\nCompiling atoi.c\nCompiling atol.c\nCompiling atoll.c\nCompiling bsearch.c\nCompiling bzero.c\nCompiling calloc.c\nCompiling fgets.c\nCompiling inline.c\n\nsnip\n\nApp successfully built: myproject/bin/arduino_boot/apps/boot/boot.elf\n\n\n\n\n\nIf this command finishes successfully, you have successfully built the Arduino \nbootloader, and the next step is to build your application for the Arduino \nboard.\n\n\n\n\nBuild your blinky app\n\n\nTo create and download your application, you create another target, this one pointing to the application you want to download to the Arduino board.  In this tutorial,  we will use the default application that comes with your project, \napps/blinky\n:\n\n\nNote\n: Remember to set features to \narduino_zero\n if your board is Arduino Zero and not a Pro!\n\n\n$ newt target create arduino_blinky \nTarget targets/arduino_blinky successfully created\n$ newt target set arduino_blinky app=apps/blinky \nTarget targets/arduino_blinky successfully set target.app to apps/blinky\n$ newt target set arduino_blinky bsp=@mynewt_arduino_zero/hw/bsp/arduino_zero\nTarget targets/arduino_blinky successfully set target.bsp to @mynewt_arduino_zero/hw/bsp/arduino_zero\n$ newt target set arduino_blinky build_profile=debug \nTarget targets/arduino_blinky successfully set target.build_profile to debug\n\n$ newt target set arduino_blinky features=arduino_zero_pro \n\nTarget targets/arduino_blinky successfully set pkg.features to arduino_zero_pro\n$ \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can now build the target, with \nnewt build\n: \n\n\n$ newt build arduino_blinky \nCompiling main.c\nArchiving blinky.a\nCompiling cons_fmt.c\nCompiling cons_tty.c\nArchiving full.a\nCompiling case.c\nCompiling suite.c\nCompiling testutil.c\nArchiving testutil.a\n\nsnip\n\nApp successfully built: myproject/bin/arduino_blinky/apps/blinky/blinky.elf\n\n\n\n\n\n Congratulations! \n You have successfully built your application. Now it's time to load both the bootloader and application onto the target.\n\n\n\n\nConnect the Target\n\n\nConnect your computer to the Arduino Zero (from now on we'll call this the \ntarget) with the Micro-USB cable through the Programming Port as shown below. \nMynewt will download and debug the target through this port. You should see a \nlittle green LED come on. That means the board has power.\n\n\nNo external debugger is required.  The Arduino Zero comes with an internal\ndebugger that can be accessed by Mynewt.\n\n\nA image below shows the Arduino Zero Programming Port.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDownload the Bootloader\n\n\nExecute the command to download the bootloader. \n\n\n    \n$\n \nnewt\n \nload\n \narduino_boot\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf the newt tool finishes without error, that means the bootloader has been \nsuccessfully loaded onto the target.\n\n\n\n\n Reminder if you are using Docker: \n When working with actual hardware, remember that each board has an ID. If you swap boards and do not refresh the USB Device Filter on the VirtualBox UI, the ID might be stale and the Docker instance may not be able to see the board correctly. For example, you may see an error message like \nError: unable to find CMSIS-DAP device\n when you try to load or run an image on the board.

Note that because the markings on the board may not always be accurate, when in doubt, you should always refer to the manual for the correct positioning. Since the jumpers are a pair, they should move together, and as such, the pair is responsible for the boot mode when bootloader is present. \nTo locate the bootloader, the board searches in three places: User Flash Memory, System Memory or the Embedded SRAM. For this Blinky project, we will configure it to boot from flash by jumpering \nB0_0\n and \nB1_0\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConnect USB-OTG#2 in the picture above to a USB port on your computer (or a powered USB hub to make sure there is enough power available to the board). \n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe red PWR LED should be lit. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nConnect the JTAG connector to the SWD/JTAG interface on the board.

Pull the USB cable off the Olimex JTAG adaptor, severing the debug connection to the JTAG port. Next power off the Olimex board by pulling out the USB cable from the board. Wait for a couple of seconds and plug the USB cable back to the board. \n\n\nThe LED light will start blinking again.

Starting with the target name, assign specific aspects of the project, as shown below, to pull the appropriate packages and build the right bundle or list for the board. For example, we set the build_profile, board support package (bsp), and app.\n\n\n    $ newt target create blinky\n    $ newt target set blinky build_profile=debug\n    $ newt target set blinky bsp=@apache-mynewt-core/hw/bsp/olimex_stm32-e407_devboard\n    $ newt target set blinky app=apps/blinky\n    $ newt target show blinky\n    targets/blinky\n        app=apps/blinky\n        bsp=hw/bsp/olimex_stm32-e407_devboard\n        build_profile=debug\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBuild the image\n\n\nNext, let's build the image for the above target. By default, the linker script within the \nhw/bsp/olimex_stm32-e407_devboard\n package builds an image for flash memory, which we don't want; instead, we want an image for the SRAM, so you need to switch that script with \nrun_from_sram.ld\n. \n\n\nAfer you build the target, you can find the executable \nblinky.elf\n in the project directory \n~/dev/myproj/bin/blinky/apps/blinky/.\n \n\n\n    $ cd ~/dev/myproj/repos/apache-mynewt-core/hw/bsp/olimex_stm32-e407_devboard/\n    $ diff olimex_stm32-e407_devboard.ld run_from_sram.ld\n    (some diff will be displayed)\n    $ cp run_from_sram.ld olimex_stm32-e407_devboard.ld\n    $ cd ~/dev/myproj\n    $ newt build blinky\n    Compiling case.c\n    Compiling suite.c\n    ...\n    Linking blinky.elf\n    App successfully built:~/dev/myproj/bin/blinky/apps/blinky/blinky.elf\n    $ ls ~/dev/myproj/bin/blinky/apps/blinky/\n        blinky.elf      blinky.elf.bin     blinky.elf.cmd  \n        blinky.elf.lst  blinky.elf.map\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrepare the hardware to boot from embedded SRAM\n\n\n\n\nLocate the boot jumpers on the board.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nB1_1/B1_0 and B0_1/B0_0 are PTH jumpers. Note that because the markings on the board may not always be accurate, when in doubt, you should always refer to the manual for the correct positioning. Since the jumpers are a pair, they should move together, and as such, the pair is responsible for the boot mode when bootloader is present. \nTo locate the bootloader, the board searches in three places: User Flash Memory, System Memory or the Embedded SRAM. For this Blinky project, we will configure it to boot from SRAM by jumpering \nB0_1\n and \nB1_1\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConnect USB-OTG#2 in the picture above to a USB port on your computer (or a powered USB hub to make sure there is enough power available to the board). \n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe red PWR LED should be lit. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nConnect the JTAG connector to the SWD/JTAG interface on the board.

            "text": "Adding Repositories to your Project\n\n\nWhat is a Repository\n\n\nA repository is a version-ed Mynewt project, which is a collection of Mynewt packages organized in a specific way for redistribution.  \n\n\nWhat differentiates a repository from a Mynewt project is the presence of a\n\nrepository.yml\n file describing the repository. This will be described \nbelow. For a basic understanding of repositories you may read the \nNewt Tool Manual\n and \nHow to create repos\n.\n\n\nNote:\n For the remainder of this document we'll use the term repo as shorthand for a Mynewt repository.\n\n\nRepos are useful because they are an organized way for the community to share Mynewt packages and projects.  In fact, the Mynewt-core is distributed as a repo.\n\n\n\n\nWhy does Mynewt need additional repos?\n\n\nRepos add functionality not included in the Mynewt core.  New repos might be created for several reasons.\n\n\n\n\nExpertise\n.  Individuals or organizations may have expertise that they want\nto share in the form of repos. For example a chip vendor may\ncreate a repo to hold the Mynewt support for their chips.\n\n\nNon-Core component\n.  Some components, although very useful to Mynewt users\nare not core to all Mynewt users.  These are likely candidates to be held in \ndifferent repos.\n\n\nSoftware licensing\n.  Some software have licenses that make them incompatible\nwith the ASF (Apache Software Foundation) license policies.  These may be \nvaluable components to some Mynewt users, but cannot be contained in the \napache-Mynewt-core\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat Repos are in my Project\n\n\nThe list of repos used by your project are contained within the \n\nproject.yml\n file.  An example can be seen by creating a new project:\n\n\n$ mkdir ~/dev\n$ cd ~/dev\n$ newt new myproj\n$ cd myproj\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nView the \nproject.yml\n section and you will see a line describing the repos:\n\n\nproject.repositories:\n    - apache-Mynewt-core\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nBy default, this newly created project uses a single repo called \n\napache-Mynewt-core\n.  \n\n\nIf you wish to add additional repos, you would add \nadditional lines to the \nproject.repositories\n variable like this.\n\n\nproject.repositories:\n    - apache-Mynewt-core\n\n    - another_repo_named_x\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRepo Descriptors\n\n\nIn addition to the repo name, the \nproject.yml\n file must also contain\na repo descriptor for each repository you include that gives \nnewt\n \ninformation on obtaining the repo.\n\n\nIn the same \nmyproj\n above you will see the following repo descriptor.\n\n\nrepository.apache-Mynewt-core:\n    type: github\n    vers: 0-latest\n    user: apache\n    repo: incubator-mynewt-core\n\n\n\n\n\nA repo descriptor starts with \nrepository.\nname\n.\n.  In this example, the \ndescriptor specifies the information for the \napache-Mynewt-core\n.\n\n\n\n\nThe fields within the descriptor have the following definitions:\n\n\n\n\n\n\ntype\n -- The type of code storage the repo uses.  The current version\nof \nnewt\n only supports github.  Future versions may support generic git or other\ncode storage mechanisms.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nvers\n -- The version of the repo to use for your project.  A source\ncode repository contains many versions of the source. This field is used to \nspecify the one to use for this project.  See the section on versions below \nfor a detailed description of the format of this field.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nuser\n -- The username for the repo.  On github, this is the name\nafter \ngithub.com\n in the repo path.  Consider the repository \n\nhttps://github.com/apache/incubator-mynewt-core\n. It has username \napache\n.  \n\n\n\n\n\n\nrepo\n -- The name of the repo.  On github, this is the name after\nthe username described above.  Consider the repository \n\nhttps://github.com/apache/incubator-mynewt-core\n. It has username \n\nincubator-mynewt-core\n.  This is a path to the source control\nand should not be confused with the name of the repo that you used in the \n\nrepository.\nname\n declaration above.   That name is contained elsewhere\nwithin the repo. See Below.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdding Existing Repos to my Project\n\n\nTo add a new repo to your project, you have to complete two steps.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdit the \nproject.yml\n file and add a new repo descriptor.  The previous\nsection includes information on the field required in your repo descriptor.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdit the \nproject/yml\n file and add a new line to the \nproject.repositories\n\nvariable with the name of the repo you are adding.  \n\n\n\n\n\n\nAn example of a \nproject.yml\n file with two repositories is shown below:\n\n\nproject.name: \nmy_project\n\n\nproject.repositories:\n    - apache-Mynewt-core\n    - Mynewt_arduino_zero\n\n# Use github\ns distribution mechanism for core ASF libraries.\n# This provides mirroring automatically for us.\n#\nrepository.apache-Mynewt-core:\n    type: github\n    vers: 0-latest\n    user: apache\n    repo: incubator-mynewt-core\n\n# a special repo to hold hardware specific stuff for arduino zero\nrepository.Mynewt_arduino_zero:\n    type: github\n    vers: 0-latest\n    user: runtimeinc\n    repo: Mynewt_arduino_zero\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat Version of the Repo to use\n\n\nMynewt repos are version-ed artifacts.  They are stored in source control \nsystems like github.  The repo descriptor in your \nproject.yml\n file must\nspecify the version of the repo you will accept into your project.\n\n\nFor now, we are at the beginnings of Mynewt. For testing and evaluation\nplease use \n0-latest\n in the \nvers\n field in your repo descriptor.\n\n\n    vers:0-latest\n\n\n\n\n\nSee \nCreate a Repo\n for a description of the versioning system and all the possible ways to specify a version to use.\n\n\n\n\nIdentifying a Repo\n\n\nA repo contains Mynewt packages organized in a specific way and stored in one of the supported code storage methods described above. In other words, it is a Mynewt project with an additional file \nrepository.yml\n which describes the repo for use by \nnewt\n (and humans browsing them). It contains a mapping of version numbers to the actual github branches containing the source code.\n\n\nNote that the \nrepository.yml\n file lives only in the master branch of the git\nrepository.  \nNewt\n will always fetch this file from the master branch and then\nuse that to determine the actual branch required depending on the version\nspecified in your \nproject.yml\n file.  Special care should be taken to ensure that this file exists only in the master branch.\n\n\nHere is the \nrepository.yml\n file from the apache-Mynewt-core:\n\n\nrepo.name: apache-mynewt-core\nrepo.versions:\n    \n0.7.9\n: \nMynewt_0_8_0_b2_tag\n\n    \n0-latest\n: \n0.7.9\n\n    \n0.8-latest\n: \n0.7.9\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt contains the following:\n\n\n\n\nrepo.name\n The external name that is used to include the library in \nyour \nproject.yml\n file.   This is the name you in include in the \nproject.repositories\n variable when adding this repository to your project.\n\n\nrepo.versions\n A description of what versions to give the user depending \non the settings in their \nproject.yml\n file.  \n\n\n\n\n\n\nRepo Version\n\n\nThe repo version number resolves to an actual git branch depending on the mapping specified in \nrepository.yml\n for that repo. The version field argument in your \nproject.yml\n file supports multiple formats for flexibility:\n\n\nmajor_num\n.\nminor_num\n.\nrevision_num\n\n\n\n\n\n\nor\n\n\nmajor_num\n.\nminor_num\n-\nstability string\n\n\n\n\n\n\nor \n\n\nmajor_num\n-\nstability string\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe stability string can be one of 3 pre-defined stability values.\n\n\n\n\nstable -- A stable release version of the repository\n\n\ndev    -- A development version from the repository\n\n\nlatest -- The latest from the repository\n\n\n\n\nIn your \nproject.yml\n file you can specify different combinations of \nthe version number and stability value.  For example:\n\n\n\n\n0-latest\n      -- The latest version with major number 0\n\n\n1.2-stable\n    -- The latest stable version with major and minor number 1.2\n\n\n1.2-dev\n       -- The development version from 1.2\n\n\n1.1.1\n         -- a specific version 1.1.1\n\n\n\n\nYou cannot specify a stability string with a fully numbered version, e.g.\n\n\n1.2.8-stable\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRepo Versions Available\n\n\nA \nrepository.yml\n file contains information to match a version request\ninto a git branch to fetch for your project.\n\n\nIt's up to the repository maintainer to map these to branches of the \nrepository.  For example, let's say in a fictitious repository the following are \ndefined.\n\n\nrepo.versions:\n    \n0.8.0\n: \nxxx_branch_0_8_0\n\n    \n1.0.0\n: \nxxx_branch_1_0_0\n\n    \n1.0.2\n: \nxxx_branch_1_0_2\n\n    \n1.1.1\n: \nxxx_branch_1_1_0\n\n    \n1.1.2\n: \nxxx_branch_1_1_2\n\n    \n1.2.0\n: \nxxx_branch_1_2_0\n\n    \n1.2.1\n: \nxxx_branch_1_2_1\n\n    \n1.2-dev\n: \n1.2.1\n\n    \n1-dev\n: \n1.2-dev\n\n    \n1.2-stable\n: \n1.2.0\n\n    \n0-latest\n: \n0.8.0\n\n    \n1-latest\n: \n1-dev\n\n    ....\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen the \nproject.yml\n file asks for \n1.2-stable\n it is resolved to version\n\n1.2.0\n (perhaps \n1.2.1\n is not stable yet), which in turn resolves to a specific\nbranch \nxxx_branch_1_2_0\n.  This is the branch that \nnewt\n fetches into \nyour project. \n\n\nNote:\n Make sure a repo version exists in the \nrepository.yml\n file of a repo you wish to add. Otherwise Newt will not be able to resolve the version and will fail to fetch the repo into your project.\n\n\n\n\nHow to find out what Repos are available for Mynewt components\n\n\nCurrently, there is no \nnewt\n command to locate/search Mynewt package \nrepositories.  However, since the \nnewt\n tool supports only github, \nsearching github by keyword is a satisfactory option until a search \ntool is created.\n\n\nWhen searching github, recall that a Mynewt repository must \nhave a \nrepository.yml\n file in its root directory. If you don't see \nthat file, it's not a Mynewt repository and can't be included in your \nproject via the newt tool.  \n\n\nOnce you find a repository, the github URL and \nrepository.yml\n file\nshould give you all the information to add it to your \nproject.yml\n file.",

For example:\n\n\n\n\n0-latest\n      -- The latest version with major number 0\n\n\n1.2-stable\n    -- The latest stable version with major and minor number 1.2\n\n\n1.2-dev\n       -- The development version from 1.2\n\n\n1.1.1\n         -- a specific version 1.1.1\n\n\n\n\nYou \ncannot\n specify a stability string with a fully numbered version, e.g.\n\n\n1.2.8-stable\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRepo Version Resolution\n\n\nA \nrepository.yml\n file contains information to match this version request\ninto a git branch to fetch for your project.\n\n\nIt's up to you as the repository maintainer to map these to actual github branches of the repository.  For example, let's say in a fictitious repository the following are defined.\n\n\nrepo.versions:\n    \n0.8.0\n: \nxxx_branch_0_8_0\n\n    \n1.0.0\n: \nxxx_branch_1_0_0\n\n    \n1.0.2\n: \nxxx_branch_1_0_2\n\n    \n1.1.1\n: \nxxx_branch_1_1_0\n\n    \n1.1.2\n: \nxxx_branch_1_1_2\n\n    \n1.2.0\n: \nxxx_branch_1_2_0\n\n    \n1.2.1\n: \nxxx_branch_1_2_1\n\n    \n1.2-dev\n: \n1.2.1\n\n    \n1-dev\n: \n1.2-dev\n\n    \n1.2-stable\n: \n1.2.0\n\n    \n0-latest\n: \n0.8.0\n\n    \n1-latest\n: \n1-dev\n\n    ....\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen the \nproject.yml\n file asks for \n1.2-stable\n it will be resolved to version\n\n1.2.0\n which in turn will resolve to a specific branch \nxxx_branch_1_2_0\n.  This is the branch that \nnewt\n will fetch into the project with that \nproject.yml\n file.\n\n\n\n\nDependencies on other repos\n\n\nRepositories can also have dependencies on other repositories.  These \ndependencies should be listed out on a per-tag basis.  So, for example, \nif apache-mynewt-core were to depend on sterlys-little-repo, you might \nhave the following directives in the repository.yml:\n\n\ndevelop.repositories:\n    sterlys-little-repo:\n        type: github\n        vers: 0.8-latest\n        user: sterlinghughes\n        repo: sterlys-little-repo\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis would tell Newt that for anything that resolves to the develop \nbranch, this repository requires the sterlys-little-repo repository. \n\n\nDependencies are resolved circularly by the newt tool, and every dependent repository is placed as a sibling in the repos directory. Currently, if two repositories have the same name, they will conflict and bad things will happen.\n\n\nWhen a repository is installed to the repos/ directory, the current \nversion of that repository is written to the \"project.state\" file.

Specifically, this lesson will cover tasks, simple multitasking, and priority management running on an Arduino M0 Pro.\n\n\nPrerequisites\n\n\nBefore starting, you should read about Mynewt in the \nIntroduction\n section and complete the \nQuickStart\n guide and the \nBlinky\n tutorial. Furthermore, it may be helpful to take a peek at the \ntask documentation\n for additional insights.\n\n\nEquipment\n\n\nYou will need the following equipment:\n\n\n\n\nArduino M0 Pro (or legacy Arduino Zero or Zero Pro, but not Arduino M0)\n\n\nComputer with Mynewt installed\n\n\nUSB to Micro USB Cable\n\n\n\n\nBuild Your Application\n\n\nTo save time, we will simply modify the Blinky app as it has the basic task structure already implemented. Follow the \nArduino Zero Blinky tutorial\n to create a new project and build your bootloader and application. Finally, build and load the application to your Arduino to verify that everything is in order. Now let\u2019s get started!\n\n\nCreate a New Task\n\n\nThe purpose of this section is to give an introduction to the important aspects of tasks and how to properly initialize them. First, let\u2019s define a second task called \nwork_task\n in main.c (located in apps/blinky/src):\n\n\nstruct\n \nos_task\n \nwork_task\n;\n\n\n\n\n\nA task is represented by the \nos_task\n  struct which will hold the task\u2019s information (name, state, priority, etc.). A task is made up of two main elements, a task function (also known as a task handler) and a task stack.\n\n\nNext, let\u2019s take a look at what is required to initialize our new task.\n\n\nTask Stack\n\n\nThe task stack is an array of type \nos_stack_t\n which holds the program stack frames. Mynewt gives us the ability to set the stack size for a task giving the application developer room to optimize memory usage. Since we\u2019re not short on memory, our \nblinky_stack\n and \nwork_stack\n are plenty large for the purpose of this lesson. Notice that the elements in our task stack are of type \nos_stack_t\n which are generally 32 bits, making our entire stack 1024 Bytes.\n\n\n  \n#define WORK_STACK_SIZE OS_STACK_ALIGN(256)\n\n  \nos_stack_t\n \nwork_stack\n[\nWORK_STACK_SIZE\n];\n\n\n\n\n\nNote: The \nOS_STACK_ALIGN\n macro is used to align the stack based on the hardware architecture.\n\n\nTask Function\n\n\nThe task function is essentially an infinite loop which waits for some \u201cevent\u201d to wake it up. In our Blinky app the task function, named \nblinky_task_handler()\n, is initially called when we call \nos_start()\n in \nmain()\n. In general, the task function is where the majority of work is done by a task. Let\u2019s write a task function for \nwork_task\n called \nwork_task_handler()\n:\n\n\nvoid\n\n\nwork_task_handler\n(\nvoid\n \n*arg\n)\n{\n    \nstruct\n \nos_task\n \n*t\n;\n\n    \ng_led_pin\n \n=\n \nLED_BLINK_PIN\n;\n    \nhal_gpio_init_out\n(\ng_led_pin\n, \n1\n);\n\n    \nwhile\n (\n1\n) {\n        \nt\n \n=\n \nos_sched_get_current_task\n();\n        \nassert\n(\nt-\nt_func\n \n==\n \nwork_task_handler\n);\n        \n/* Do work... */\n\n    }\n}\n\n\n\n\n\nThe task function is called when the task is initially put into the \nrunning\n state by the scheduler. We use an infinite loop to ensure that the task function never returns. Our assertion that the current task's handler is the same as our task handler is for illustration purposes only and does not need to be in most task functions.\n\n\nTask Priority\n\n\nAs a preemptive, multitasking RTOS, Mynewt decides which tasks to run based on which has a higher priority; the highest priority being 0 and the lowest 255. Thus, before initializing our task, we must choose a priority defined as a macro variable.\n\n\nLet\u2019s set the priority of \nwork_task\n to 0, because everyone knows that work is more important than blinking.\n\n\n  \n#define WORK_TASK_PRIO (0)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInitialization\n\n\nTo initialize a new task we use \nos_task_init()\n which takes a number of arguments including our new task function, stack, and priority. Much like \nblinky_task\n, we\u2019re going to initialize \nwork_task\n inside \ninit_tasks\n to keep our main function clean.\n\n\nint\n\n\ninit_tasks\n(\nvoid\n)\n{\n    \n/* \u2026 */\n\n    \nos_task_init\n(\nwork_task\n, \nwork\n, \nwork_task_handler\n, \nNULL\n,\n            \nWORK_TASK_PRIO\n, \nOS_WAIT_FOREVER\n, \nwork_stack\n,\n            \nWORK_STACK_SIZE\n);\n\n    \ntasks_initialized\n \n=\n \n1\n;\n    \nreturn\n \n0\n;\n}\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd that\u2019s it! Now run your application using the newt run command.\n\n\n$ newt run arduino_blinky 0.0.0\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen GDB appears press C then Enter to continue and \u2026 \nwait, why doesn't our LED blink anymore?\n\n\nReview\n\n\nBefore we run our new app, let\u2019s review what we need in order to create a task. This is a general case for a new task called mytask:\n\n\n1)\n   Define a new task, task stack, and priority:\n\n\n/* My Task */\n\n\nstruct\n \nos_task\n \nmytask\n\n\n/* My Task Stack */\n\n\n#define MYTASK_STACK_SIZE OS_STACK_ALIGN(256)\n\n\nos_stack_t\n \nmytask_stack\n[\nMYTASK_STACK_SIZE\n];\n\n/* My Task Priority */\n\n\n#define MYTASK_PRIO (0)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2)\n Define task function:\n\n\nvoid\n \n\nmytask_handler\n(\nvoid\n \n*arg\n)\n{\n  \nwhile\n (\n1\n) {\n      \n/* ... */\n\n  }\n}\n\n\n\n\n\n3)\n Initialize task before calling \nos_start()\n:\n\n\nos_task_init\n(\nmytask\n, \nmytask\n, \nmytask_handler\n, \nNULL\n, \n            \nMYTASK_PRIO\n, \nOS_WAIT_FOREVER\n, \nmytask_stack\n,\n            \nMYTASK_STACK_SIZE\n);\n\n\n\n\n\nTask Priority, Preempting, and Context Switching\n\n\nA preemptive RTOS is one in which a higher priority task that is \nready to run\n will preempt (i.e. take the place of) the lower priority task which is \nrunning\n. When a lower priority task is preempted by a higher priority task, the lower priority task\u2019s context data (stack pointer, registers, etc.) is saved and the new task is switched in.\n\n\nIn our example, \nwork_task\n has a higher priority than \nblinky_task\n and, because it is never put into a \nsleep\n state, holds the processor focus on its context. Let\u2019s give \nwork_task\n a delay and some simulated work to keep it busy. Because the delay is measured in os ticks, the actual number of ticks per second is dependent on the board. Therefore, we multiply \nOS_TICKS_PER_SEC\n, which is defined in the MCU, by the number of seconds we wish to delay.\n\n\nvoid\n\n\nwork_task_handler\n(\nvoid\n \n*arg\n)\n{\n    \nstruct\n \nos_task\n \n*t\n;\n\n    \ng_led_pin\n \n=\n \nLED_BLINK_PIN\n;\n    \nhal_gpio_init_out\n(\ng_led_pin\n, \n1\n);\n\n    \nwhile\n (\n1\n) {\n        \nt\n \n=\n \nos_sched_get_current_t\n:ask\n();\n        \nassert\n(\nt-\nt_func\n \n==\n \nwork_task_handler\n);\n        \n/* Do work... */\n\n        \nint\n \ni\n;\n        \nfor\n(\ni\n \n=\n \n0\n; \ni\n \n \n1000000\n; \n++i\n) {\n            \n/* Simulate doing a noticeable amount of work */\n\n            \nhal_gpio_set\n(\ng_led_pin\n);\n        }\n        \nos_time_delay\n(\n3\n*OS_TICKS_PER_SECOND\n);\n    }\n}\n\n\n\n\n\nIn order to notice the LED changing, modify the time delay in \nblinky_task_handler()\n to blink at a higher frequency.\n\n\nos_time_delay\n(\nOS_TICKS_PER_SEC/\n10\n);\n\n\n\n\n\nBefore we run the app, let\u2019s predict the behavior. With the newest additions to \nwork_task_handler()\n, our first action will be to sleep for three seconds. This will allow \nblinky_task\n to take over the CPU and blink to its heart\u2019s content. After three seconds, \nwork_task\n will wake up and be made \nready to run\n, causing it to preempt \nblinky_task\n. The LED will then remain lit for a short period while \nwork_task\n loops, then blink again for another three seconds while \nwork_task\n sleeps. \n\n\nVoila, you should see that our prediction was correct! \n\n\nPriority Management Considerations\n\n\nWhen projects grow in scope, from blinking LEDs into more sophisticated applications, the number of tasks needed increases alongside complexity. It remains important, then, that each of our tasks is capable of doing its work within a reasonable amount of time.\n\n\nSome tasks, such as the Shell task, execute quickly and require almost instantaneous response. Therefore, the Shell task should be given a high priority. On the other hand, tasks which may be communicating over a network, or processing data, should be given a low priority in order to not hog the CPU.\n\n\nThe diagram below showcases the different scheduling patterns we. would expect from swapping blinky and work tasks priorities.\n\n\n\n\nIn the second case where \nblinky_task\n has a higher priority, the \u201cwork\u201d done by \nwork_task\n would be executed during the millisecond delays in \nblinky_task\n, saving us idle time compared to the first case.\n\n\nNote:\n Defining the same priority for two tasks leads to somewhat undefined behavior and should be avoided.\n\n\nComparing Priority Strategies\n\n\nInstead of stepping through a bunch of changes to our blinky app, clone my task lesson application from github and copy an existing target.\n\n\nChange directory into apps and clone the repository to get our new\nfiles:\n\n\n$ cd apps\n$ git clone https://github.com/bgiori/mynewt_tasks_lesson.git\n\n\n\n\n\nChange directory back to your project root and copy  the arduino_blinky target to a new target called task_tgt.\n\n\n$\n \nnewt\n \ntarget\n \ncopy\n \narduino_blinky\n \ntask_tgt\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSet a new app location.\n\n\n$\n \nnewt\n \ntarget\n \nset\n \ntask_tgt\n \napp=apps/mynewt_tasks_lesson\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNow let\u2019s take a look at our new code. First, notice that we have abandoned blinking, instead choosing to use the \nconsole\n and \nshell\n to follow our tasks through execution.\n\n\nAdditionally, we have a number of different tasks:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTask A\n (\na_task\n):\n\n\n\n\nPriority\n: 3 \u2192 2\n\n\nDescription\n: Task A is supposed to represent a task which frequently does a small amount of work, such as one which rapidly polls a sensor for data. Much like \nblinky_task\n, Task A will loop 10,000 times then wait 1 millisecond. Priority is changed by \ntimer_task\n after the first simulation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTask B\n (\nb_task\n):\n\n\n\n\nPriority\n: 2 \u2192 3\n\n\nDescription\n: Task B is supposed to represent a task which does a large amount of work relatively infrequently, such as one which sends/receives data from the cloud. Like work_task, Task B will loop 1,000,000 times then wait 3 seconds. Priority is changed by timer_task after the first simulation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTimer Task\n (\ntimer_task\n):\n\n\n\n\nPriority\n: 1\n\n\nDescription\n: With default settings, Timer Task will wait 20 seconds then print the first simulations data for Task A and B. Timer task will then swap A and B\u2019s priorities and restart the simulation. After the second simulation, timer will again print simulation data then compare the two and calculate a final speedup (simulation2 / simulation1).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShell Task\n:\n\n\n\n\nPriority\n: 0\n\n\nDescription\n: Task used by Shell behind the scenes to communicate with the serial port.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConnecting to the Serial Console\n\n\nBefore running our new app, we must first connect to the serial console. First make sure the mynewt_arduino_zero repository is set to the develop branch. (Remove once changes have been moved to master). \n\n\n$ cd repos/mynewt_arduino_zero\n$ git checkout develop\n\n\n\n\n\nOpen a new terminal window and list your serial connections to find our Arduino.\n\n\n$\n \nls\n \n/dev/tty\n.\n*\n\n\n\n/dev/tty\n.\nBluetooth-Incoming-Port\n \n/dev/tty\n.\nusbmodem14132\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the same window, connect to the serial port using a serial communication program.

Let\u2019s take a look at scheduling differences before we delve into efficiency.\n\n\nIn the first case, where Task B\u2019s priority is higher than that of Task A, we see A get starved by Task B\u2019s long execution time. \nStarvation\n occurs when one task hogs the processor, essentially \u201cstarving\u201d other tasks which also need to run. At the end of the first 20 second simulation period, Task A has only run for 1.4 seconds compared to task B\u2019s 17 second running time \u2013 ouch. As explained before, processes which are expected to run for long periods of time (e.g. network communication, data processing) should be given higher priorities in order to combat starvation.\n\n\nIn the second simulation with priorities swapped, we can see Task B only running during the millisecond delays when Task A is \nsleeping\n. Although having Task B only run during these delays slows its execution time, we benefit from un-starving Task A and using the processor at a higher efficiency.\n\n\nThe bottom line speedup gives us an immediate and clear indication that we have improved our ability to process work (i.e throughput). In our second run, we processed an additional 400,000 loop iterations, equating to a 26% increase in efficiency. On a standard multi-core processor found in every modern PC, a 1.26 speedup would be an ok result to adding multithreading capabilities to a serial program. However, we accomplished this by simply setting priorities on a single core processor \u2013 not bad!\n\n\nNOTE: Usually the the term \u201cspeedup\u201d is used within a parallel programming context and refers to the change in execution time between a serial and parallel program executing over the same problem. In this case we\u2019re using the term loosely to illustrate the priority change\u2019s effect on scheduling and throughput in our specific context.\n\n\nEfficiency Isn\u2019t Everything\n\n\nUsing the processor during every OS tick isn\u2019t always the best course of action. If we modify Task A\u2019s delay to a tenth of a millisecond and turn off the console output, we can boost our speedup to 1.44. This, however, reduces our ability to process work from Task B who ends up only completing 18% of its work cycle after the second simulation. That would mean, at that rate, Task B would take over a minute to finish one cycle.\n\n\nFeel free to play around with the testing parameters to study the different changes yourself!\n\n\nConclusion\n\n\nMoving forward, tasks are just the tip of the iceberg. The \nscheduler\n, \nevent queues\n, \nsemaphores\n, and \nmutexes\n also add to tasks functionality, increasing our ability as the developer to control greater numbers of tasks more intricately. For example, when we switch the tasks priority, we have to tell the scheduler that our tasks priorities have changed, allowing us us to use priorities dynamically. When running multiple tasks, logging through either the built-in \nLogs\n module (not covered in this lesson) or through the serial console/shell can be very useful for debugging your application. In the end, the way you manage your tasks depends on the context of your application. You should assign priorities based on execution time, urgency, and frequency, among other things.\n\n\nKeep blinking and happy hacking!",

In our example,  work_task  has a higher priority than  blinky_task  and, because it is never put into a  sleep  state, holds the processor focus on its context. Let\u2019s give  work_task  a delay and some simulated work to keep it busy. Because the delay is measured in os ticks, the actual number of ticks per second is dependent on the board. Therefore, we multiply  OS_TICKS_PER_SEC , which is defined in the MCU, by the number of seconds we wish to delay.  void  work_task_handler ( void   *arg )\n{\n     struct   os_task   *t ;\n\n     g_led_pin   =   LED_BLINK_PIN ;\n     hal_gpio_init_out ( g_led_pin ,  1 );\n\n     while  ( 1 ) {\n         t   =   os_sched_get_current_t :ask ();\n         assert ( t- t_func   ==   work_task_handler );\n         /* Do work... */ \n         int   i ;\n         for ( i   =   0 ;  i     1000000 ;  ++i ) {\n             /* Simulate doing a noticeable amount of work */ \n             hal_gpio_set ( g_led_pin );\n        }\n         os_time_delay ( 3 *OS_TICKS_PER_SECOND );\n    }\n}  In order to notice the LED changing, modify the time delay in  blinky_task_handler()  to blink at a higher frequency.  os_time_delay ( OS_TICKS_PER_SEC/ 10 );  Before we run the app, let\u2019s predict the behavior. With the newest additions to  work_task_handler() , our first action will be to sleep for three seconds. This will allow  blinky_task  to take over the CPU and blink to its heart\u2019s content.

The diagram below showcases the different scheduling patterns we. would expect from swapping blinky and work tasks priorities.

Let\u2019s take a look at scheduling differences before we delve into efficiency.  In the first case, where Task B\u2019s priority is higher than that of Task A, we see A get starved by Task B\u2019s long execution time.  Starvation  occurs when one task hogs the processor, essentially \u201cstarving\u201d other tasks which also need to run. At the end of the first 20 second simulation period, Task A has only run for 1.4 seconds compared to task B\u2019s 17 second running time \u2013 ouch. As explained before, processes which are expected to run for long periods of time (e.g. network communication, data processing) should be given higher priorities in order to combat starvation.  In the second simulation with priorities swapped, we can see Task B only running during the millisecond delays when Task A is  sleeping . Although having Task B only run during these delays slows its execution time, we benefit from un-starving Task A and using the processor at a higher efficiency.  The bottom line speedup gives us an immediate and clear indication that we have improved our ability to process work (i.e throughput). In our second run, we processed an additional 400,000 loop iterations, equating to a 26% increase in efficiency. On a standard multi-core processor found in every modern PC, a 1.26 speedup would be an ok result to adding multithreading capabilities to a serial program.

The way to do this is to register your command handler with shell. Whenever your custom command is issued, you can respond to it.\n\n\nThe way you do this is first adding a dependency to shell package for your senseair driver. So you change libs/my_drivers/senseair/pkg.yml to have the following:\n\n\npkg.name: libs/my_drivers/senseair\npkg.deps:\n    - \n@apache-mynewt-core/hw/hal\n\n    - \n@apache-mynewt-core/libs/shell\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd then register your shell command in \nsenseair_init()\n.\n\n\n[user@IsMyLaptop:~/src/air_quality]$ cat libs/my_drivers/senseair/src/senseair.c\n ....\n\n\n\n\n\n#include \nshell/shell.h\n\n\n#include \nconsole/console.h\n\n\n\nstatic\n \nint\n \nsenseair_shell_func\n(\nint\n \nargc\n, \nchar\n \n**argv\n);\n\nstatic\n \nstruct\n \nshell_cmd\n \nsenseair_cmd\n \n=\n {\n    .\nsc_cmd\n \n=\n \nsenseair\n,\n    .\nsc_cmd_func\n \n=\n \nsenseair_shell_func\n,\n};\n\n\nvoid\n\n\nsenseair_init\n(\nvoid\n)\n{\n    \nint\n \nrc\n;\n\n    \nrc\n \n=\n \nshell_cmd_register\n(\nsenseair_cmd\n);\n    \nassert\n(\nrc\n \n==\n \n0\n);\n}\n\n\nstatic\n \nint\n\n\nsenseair_shell_func\n(\nint\n \nargc\n, \nchar\n \n**argv\n)\n{\n    \nconsole_printf\n(\nYay!

On the STM32F3-Discovery Board pin PA9 is TX and pin PA10 is RX so wire PA9 to RX on your serial board, and PA10 to TX on your serial board.\n\n\n    [user@IsMyLaptop:~]$ minicom -D /dev/tty.usbserial-AH02MIE2\n\n\n    Welcome to minicom 2.7\n\n    OPTIONS: \n    Compiled on Oct 12 2015, 07:48:30.\n    Port /dev/tty.usbserial-AH02MIE2, 13:44:40\n\n    Press CTRL-X Z for help on special keys\n\n    ?\n    141964:Unknown command ?\n    ?\n    143804:config   log     echo    ?       tasks   mempools \n    143806:stat     senseair \n    senseair\n    150644:Yay!

You can connect the hardware to board and start developing code for the driver itself.\n\n\nUse of HAL for drivers\n\n\nThe sensor has a serial port connection, and that's how you are going to connect to it. Your original BSP, hw/bsp/stm32f3discovery, has only one UART set up (as specified in src/hal_bsp.c, include/hal/bsp.h). Therefore, you need to create your own bsp which has configuration for this added hardware.\n\n\nSo in the shell you make a copy of the original BSP, and then change the package file a little.\n\n\n[user@IsMyLaptop:~/src/air_quality]$ mkdir hw\n[user@IsMyLaptop:~/src/air_quality]$ mkdir hw/bsp\n\n[user@IsMyLaptop:~/src/air_quality]$ cp -R repos/mynewt_stm32f3/hw/bsp/stm32f3discovery hw/bsp/stm32f3discovery_with_senseair\n\n\n\n\n\nThen you modify the pkg.yml in the copied BSP to assign name for this package. And modify the dependency for MCU package to point to mynewt_stm32f3 repository.\n\n\n    [user@IsMyLaptop:~/src/air_quality]$ grep pkg.name hw/bsp/stm32f3discovery_with_senseair/pkg.yml\n    pkg.name: \nhw/bsp/stm32f3discovery_with_senseair\n\n    [user@IsMyLaptop:~/src/air_quality]$ tail -2 hw/bsp/stm32f3discovery_with_senseair/pkg.yml\npkg.deps:\n    - \n@mynewt_stm32f3/hw/mcu/stm/stm32f3xx\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd you want to use this BSP with my target. So you change the BSP in the target definition.\n\n\nHere's your new target.\n\n\n[user@IsMyLaptop:~/src/air_quality]$ newt target show air_q\ntargets/air_q\n    app=apps/air_quality\n    bsp=hw/bsp/stm32f3discovery_with_senseair\n    build_profile=debug\n\n\n\n\n\nYou add the 2nd serial port to my new BSP. Go to hw/bsp/stm32f3discovery_with_senseair directory to do this.\n\n\nModify the include/hal/bsp.h to increase UART_CNT to 2, and add a definition of the 2nd logical UART. You will use this in your sensor driver.\n\n\nstatic\n \nconst\n \nstruct\n \nstm32f3_uart_cfg\n \nuart_cfg\n[\nUART_CNT\n] \n=\n {\n    [\n0\n] \n=\n {\n        .\nsuc_uart\n \n=\n \nUSART1\n,\n        .\nsuc_rcc_cmd\n \n=\n \nRCC_APB2PeriphClockCmd\n,\n        .\nsuc_rcc_dev\n \n=\n \nRCC_APB2Periph_USART1\n,\n        .\nsuc_pin_tx\n \n=\n \n9\n,\n        .\nsuc_pin_rx\n \n=\n \n10\n,\n        .\nsuc_pin_rts\n \n=\n \n12\n,\n        .\nsuc_pin_cts\n \n=\n \n11\n,\n        .\nsuc_pin_af\n \n=\n \nGPIO_AF_7\n,\n        .\nsuc_irqn\n \n=\n \nUSART1_IRQn\n\n    },\n    [\n1\n] \n=\n {\n        .\nsuc_uart\n \n=\n \nUSART2\n,\n        .\nsuc_rcc_cmd\n \n=\n \nRCC_APB1PeriphClockCmd\n,\n        .\nsuc_rcc_dev\n \n=\n \nRCC_APB1Periph_USART2\n,\n        .\nsuc_pin_tx\n \n=\n \n19\n, \n/* PB3 */\n\n        .\nsuc_pin_rx\n \n=\n \n20\n, \n/* PB4 */\n\n        .\nsuc_pin_rts\n \n=\n \n1\n,\n        .\nsuc_pin_cts\n \n=\n \n0\n,\n        .\nsuc_pin_af\n \n=\n \nGPIO_AF_7\n,\n        .\nsuc_irqn\n \n=\n \nUSART2_IRQn\n\n    }\n};\n\n\n\n\n\nWith this in place, you can refer to serial port where your SenseAir sensor is by a logical number. This makes the code more platform independent - you could connect this sensor to another board, like Olimex. You will also use the HAL UART abstraction to do the UART port setup and data transfer. That way you don't need to have any platform dependent pieces within your little driver.\n\n\nYou will now see what the driver code ends up looking like.

[user@IsMyLaptop:~/src/air_quality]$ cat libs/my_drivers/senseair/src/senseair.c\n ....  #include  shell/shell.h  #include  console/console.h  static   int   senseair_shell_func ( int   argc ,  char   **argv ); static   struct   shell_cmd   senseair_cmd   =  {\n    . sc_cmd   =   senseair ,\n    . sc_cmd_func   =   senseair_shell_func ,\n}; void  senseair_init ( void )\n{\n     int   rc ;\n\n     rc   =   shell_cmd_register ( senseair_cmd );\n     assert ( rc   ==   0 );\n} static   int  senseair_shell_func ( int   argc ,  char   **argv )\n{\n     console_printf ( Yay! Somebody called!\\n );\n     return   0 ;\n}  Then you build this, download to target, and start minicom on your console port.  You'll need to wire up your Board to a Serial converter first. On the STM32F3-Discovery Board pin PA9 is TX and pin PA10 is RX so wire PA9 to RX on your serial board, and PA10 to TX on your serial board.

            "text": "The sensor has a serial port connection, and that's how you are going to connect to it. Your original BSP, hw/bsp/stm32f3discovery, has only one UART set up (as specified in src/hal_bsp.c, include/hal/bsp.h). Therefore, you need to create your own bsp which has configuration for this added hardware.  So in the shell you make a copy of the original BSP, and then change the package file a little.  [user@IsMyLaptop:~/src/air_quality]$ mkdir hw\n[user@IsMyLaptop:~/src/air_quality]$ mkdir hw/bsp\n\n[user@IsMyLaptop:~/src/air_quality]$ cp -R repos/mynewt_stm32f3/hw/bsp/stm32f3discovery hw/bsp/stm32f3discovery_with_senseair  Then you modify the pkg.yml in the copied BSP to assign name for this package. And modify the dependency for MCU package to point to mynewt_stm32f3 repository.      [user@IsMyLaptop:~/src/air_quality]$ grep pkg.name hw/bsp/stm32f3discovery_with_senseair/pkg.yml\n    pkg.name:  hw/bsp/stm32f3discovery_with_senseair \n    [user@IsMyLaptop:~/src/air_quality]$ tail -2 hw/bsp/stm32f3discovery_with_senseair/pkg.yml\npkg.deps:\n    -  @mynewt_stm32f3/hw/mcu/stm/stm32f3xx   And you want to use this BSP with my target.

[user@IsMyLaptop:~/src/air_quality]$ newt target show air_q\ntargets/air_q\n    app=apps/air_quality\n    bsp=hw/bsp/stm32f3discovery_with_senseair\n    build_profile=debug  You add the 2nd serial port to my new BSP. Go to hw/bsp/stm32f3discovery_with_senseair directory to do this.  Modify the include/hal/bsp.h to increase UART_CNT to 2, and add a definition of the 2nd logical UART. You will use this in your sensor driver.  static   const   struct   stm32f3_uart_cfg   uart_cfg [ UART_CNT ]  =  {\n    [ 0 ]  =  {\n        . suc_uart   =   USART1 ,\n        . suc_rcc_cmd   =   RCC_APB2PeriphClockCmd ,\n        . suc_rcc_dev   =   RCC_APB2Periph_USART1 ,\n        . suc_pin_tx   =   9 ,\n        . suc_pin_rx   =   10 ,\n        . suc_pin_rts   =   12 ,\n        . suc_pin_cts   =   11 ,\n        . suc_pin_af   =   GPIO_AF_7 ,\n        . suc_irqn   =   USART1_IRQn \n    },\n    [ 1 ]  =  {\n        . suc_uart   =   USART2 ,\n        . suc_rcc_cmd   =   RCC_APB1PeriphClockCmd ,\n        . suc_rcc_dev   =   RCC_APB1Periph_USART2 ,\n        . suc_pin_tx   =   19 ,  /* PB3 */ \n        . suc_pin_rx   =   20 ,  /* PB4 */ \n        . suc_pin_rts   =   1 ,\n        . suc_pin_cts   =   0 ,\n        . suc_pin_af   =   GPIO_AF_7 ,\n        . suc_irqn   =   USART2_IRQn \n    }\n};  With this in place, you can refer to serial port where your SenseAir sensor is by a logical number. This makes the code more platform independent - you could connect this sensor to another board, like Olimex. You will also use the HAL UART abstraction to do the UART port setup and data transfer. That way you don't need to have any platform dependent pieces within your little driver.  You will now see what the driver code ends up looking like.

            "text": "How to define a task which uses event queues to manage multiple events\n\n\nIntroduction\n\n\nEvent queue is a mechanism by which you can serialize incoming events for your task. You can use it to get info about arrived hardware interrupts, callout expirations and messages from other tasks.\n\n\nThe benefit of doing inter-task communication this way is that there should be less resources that need to be locked.\n\n\nThe benefit of doing interrupt processing in a task context instead of inside an interrupt context is that you are not blocking other HW interrupts when doing the work. The same goes for high priority tasks in the system; they're blocked until the interrupt handler returns. From the task context you'll also be able to access other OS facilities; you can sleep while waiting for a lock, for example.\n\n\n\n\nExample app\n\n\nHere you are going to write an app which demonstrates the use of event queues for communication between tasks. You will  also use OS callouts for timer expiration and another event from a GPIO interrupt.\n\n\nYou will  use inputs from 3 sources to toggle 3 GPIO outputs on my STM32F3discovery board.\n\n\n\n\nCreate project\n\n\nYou start by creating a project and populating it with repositories incubator-mynewt-core and mynewt_stm32f3. See \nSTM32F3 tutorial\n if you need help with this. You can also read the tutorial on \nAdditional Repositories\n for a more thorough understanding. \n\n\n \n\n\nCreate application\n\n\nHere's what the pkg.yml looks for the application.\n\n\n[marko@IsMyLaptop:~/src/events]$ cat apps/event_sample/pkg.yml\npkg.name: apps/event_sample\npkg.type: app\n\npkg.deps:\n    - \n@apache-mynewt-core/libs/os\n\n    - \n@apache-mynewt-core/hw/hal\n\n    - \n@apache-mynewt-core/libs/console/stub\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInitialize the event queue structure\n\n\nThis must be done before anyone tries to place events to the queue. Here it's done before any task gets created. Initialization is done by calling \nos_eventq_init()\n.\n\n\n#define MY_TASK_PRIO        4\n\n\n#define MY_TASK_STACK_SZ    512\n\n\n\nstatic\n \nstruct\n \nos_eventq\n \nmy_eventq\n;\n\nstatic\n \nos_stack_t\n \nmy_task_stack\n[\nMY_TASK_STACK_SZ\n];\n\nstatic\n \nstruct\n \nos_task\n \nmy_task_str\n;\n\n\nvoid\n\n\ninit_tasks\n(\nvoid\n)\n{\n    \nstruct\n \nos_task\n \ntaskid\n;\n\n    \nos_eventq_init\n(\nmy_eventq\n);\n    \nos_task_init\n(\nmy_task_str\n, \ntask\n, \nmy_task\n, \nNULL\n, \nMY_TASK_PRIO\n,\n        \nOS_WAIT_FOREVER\n, \nmy_task_stack\n, \nMY_TASK_STACK_SZ\n);\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProcessing events\n\n\nHere event processing is done inside \nmy_task\n. The main loop of the task is pulling events from the queue, and then taking action. We look at the type of the event to figure out what to do.\n\n\nThe code snippet shows what the main loop of the event handler looks like. Events are removed from the head of the queue using os_eventq_get\n\n\nvoid\n\n\nmy_task\n(\nvoid\n \n*arg\n)\n{\n    \nstruct\n \nos_event\n \n*ev\n;\n\n    \nwhile\n (\n1\n) {\n        \nev\n \n=\n \nos_eventq_get\n(\nmy_eventq\n);\n        \nswitch\n (\nev-\nev_type\n) {\n        \n/* more event types here */\n\n        \ndefault\n:\n\n            \nassert\n(\n0\n);\n        }\n    }\n}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEvent types\n\n\nYou can define your own event types. Some numbers are already reserved by the OS, so you should not use those as your own types.\n\n\nReserved event types are defined in \nlibs/os/include/os/os_eventq.h\n. One example of a reserved type is OS_EVENT_T_TIMER, which is used as type in OS callouts.\n\n\nYou should start your event numbers from \nOS_EVENT_T_PERUSER\n, and go higher.\n\n\nYou are going to generate events from GPIO interrupt handler, from another task as well as from a callout. OS callout already has a type, but you'll need to define types for the other uses.\n\n\n#define MY_TASK_GPIO_EVENT  (OS_EVENT_T_PERUSER)\n\n\n#define MY_TASK_TASK_EVENT  (OS_EVENT_T_PERUSER + 1)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPosting events from another task\n\n\nEvents are posted to a queue by calling \nos_eventq_put()\n. You need to preallocate memory for the event structure. Here it's done by declaring the event structure as a global variable.\n\n\nNote that you can call \nos_eventq_put()\n with an event which has already been queued. In that case, the call has no effect; the position of the event is not changed within the queue.\n\n\nIn the code snippet we declare the os_event structure, and initialize it. We also create the event generating task, and periodically post event to the event queue.\n\n\n#define GEN_TASK_PRIO       3\n\n\n#define GEN_TASK_STACK_SZ   512\n\n\n\nstatic\n \nstruct\n \nos_event\n \ngen_task_ev\n;\n\nstatic\n \nos_stack_t\n \ngen_task_stack\n[\nGEN_TASK_STACK_SZ\n];\n\nstatic\n \nstruct\n \nos_task\n \ngen_task_str\n;\n\n\nvoid\n\n\ngen_task\n(\nvoid\n \n*arg\n)\n{\n    \nwhile\n (\n1\n) {\n        \nos_time_delay\n(\nOS_TICKS_PER_SEC\n \n/\n \n4\n);\n        \nos_eventq_put\n(\nmy_eventq\n, \ngen_task_ev\n);\n    }\n}\n\n\nvoid\n\n\ninit_tasks\n(\nvoid\n)\n{\n    \n/* .... */\n\n    \ngen_task_ev\n.\nev_type\n \n=\n \nMY_TASK_TASK_EVENT\n;\n    \nos_task_init\n(\ngen_task_str\n, \ngen_task\n, \ngen_task\n, \nNULL\n, \nGEN_TASK_PRIO\n,\n        \nOS_WAIT_FOREVER\n, \ngen_task_stack\n, \nGEN_TASK_STACK_SZ\n);\n}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCallout events\n\n\nYou can get timer events delivered to your task's event queue with OS callout.

This routine will then post event to your queue.\n\n\nOn STM32F3Discovery board, there is a button connected to PA0.

LEDs on this board are connected to PE8, PE9, PE10 and so on. These have GPIO identifiers starting from 72 onwards.\n\n\n#define TASK_LED        72\n\n\n#define CALLOUT_LED     73\n\n\n#define GPIO_LED        74\n\n\n\nvoid\n\n\ninit_tasks\n(\nvoid\n)\n{\n    \n/* .... */\n\n    \nhal_gpio_init_out\n(\nTASK_LED\n, \n1\n);\n    \nhal_gpio_init_out\n(\nCALLOUT_LED\n, \n1\n);\n    \nhal_gpio_init_out\n(\nGPIO_LED\n, \n1\n);\n}\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd here is the new main loop for your task.

You can use it to get info about arrived hardware interrupts, callout expirations and messages from other tasks.  The benefit of doing inter-task communication this way is that there should be less resources that need to be locked.  The benefit of doing interrupt processing in a task context instead of inside an interrupt context is that you are not blocking other HW interrupts when doing the work. The same goes for high priority tasks in the system; they're blocked until the interrupt handler returns. From the task context you'll also be able to access other OS facilities; you can sleep while waiting for a lock, for example.",

You should see the green LED blinking. If not, try powercycling the board.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNow you have to set up the serial connection from your computer to the Olimex board. Locate the PC6/USART6_TX (pin#3), PC7/USART6_RX (pin#4), and GND (pin#2) of the UEXT connector on the Olimex board. More information on the UEXT connector can be found at \nhttps://www.olimex.com/Products/Modules/UEXT/\n. The schematic of the board can be found at \nhttps://www.olimex.com/Products/ARM/ST/STM32-E407/resources/STM32-E407_sch.pdf\n for reference.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConnect the female RX pin of the USB-TTL serial cable to the TX of the UEXT connector on the board. \n\n\nConnect the female TX pin of the USB-TTL serial cable to the RX of the UEXT connector on the board. \n\n\nConnect the GND pin of the USB-TTL serial cable to the GND of the UEXT connector on the board.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLocate the serial connection established in the /dev directory of your computer. It should be of the type \ntty.usbserial-\nsome identifier\n.\n\n\n\n\n        $ ls /dev/tty.usbserial-AJ03HAQQ \n        /dev/tty.usbserial-AJ03HAQQ\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou now have to define a connection profile using newtmgr. You can give it any name you want.

The attribute table is called gatt_svr_svcs ; here are the first several lines from this table:   static   const   struct   ble_gatt_svc_def   gatt_svr_svcs []  =  {\n    {\n         /*** Service: GAP. */ \n        . type                 =   BLE_GATT_SVC_TYPE_PRIMARY ,\n        . uuid128              =   BLE_UUID16 ( BLE_GAP_SVC_UUID16 ),\n        . characteristics      =  ( struct   ble_gatt_chr_def []) { {\n             /*** Characteristic: Device Name. */ \n            . uuid128              =   BLE_UUID16 ( BLE_GAP_CHR_UUID16_DEVICE_NAME ),\n            . access_cb            =   gatt_svr_chr_access_gap ,\n            . flags                =   BLE_GATT_CHR_F_READ ,\n        }, {\n             /*** Characteristic: Appearance. */ \n            . uuid128              =   BLE_UUID16 ( BLE_GAP_CHR_UUID16_APPEARANCE ),\n            . access_cb            =   gatt_svr_chr_access_gap ,\n            . flags                =   BLE_GATT_CHR_F_READ ,\n        }, {\n     // [...]    As you can see, the table is an array of service definitions ( struct ble_gatt_svc_def ).  This code excerpt contains a small part of the GAP service .  The GAP service exposes generic information about a device,\nsuch as its name and appearance.  Support for the GAP service is mandatory for\nall BLE peripherals.  Let's now consider the contents of this table in more\ndetail.  A service definition consists of the following fields:     Field  Meaning  Notes      type  Specifies whether this is a primary or secondary service.  Secondary services are not very common.  When in doubt, specify  BLE_GATT_SVC_TYPE_PRIMARY  for new services.    uuid128  The 128-bit UUID of this service.  If the service has a 16-bit UUID, you can convert it to its corresponding 128-bit UUID with the  BLE_UUID16()  macro.    characteristics  The array of characteristics that belong to this service.       A service is little more than a container of characteristics; the\ncharacteristics themselves are where the real action happens.  A characteristic\ndefinition consists of the following fields:     Field  Meaning  Notes      uuid128  The 128-bit UUID of this characteristic.  If the characteristic has a 16-bit UUID, you can convert it to its corresponding 128-bit UUID with the  BLE_UUID16()  macro.    access_cb  A callback function that gets executed whenever a peer device accesses this characteristic.  For reads:  this function generates the value that gets sent back to the peer. For writes:  this function provides the written value as an argument.    flags  Indicates which operations are permitted for this characteristic.  The NimBLE stack responds negatively when a peer attempts an unsupported operation.  The full list of flags can be found under  ble_gatt_chr_flags  in  net/nimble/host/include/host/ble_gatt.h .     The access callback is what implements the characteristic's behavior.  Access\ncallbacks are described in detail in the next section: BLE Peripheral - Characteristic Access .  The service definition array and each characteristic definition array is\nterminated with an empty entry, represented with a 0.  The below code listing\nshows the last service in the array, including terminating zeros for the\ncharacteristic array and service array.       {\n         /*** Alert Notification Service. */ \n        . type   =   BLE_GATT_SVC_TYPE_PRIMARY ,\n        . uuid128   =   BLE_UUID16 ( GATT_SVR_SVC_ALERT_UUID ),\n        . characteristics   =  ( struct   ble_gatt_chr_def []) { {\n            . uuid128   =   BLE_UUID16 ( GATT_SVR_CHR_SUP_NEW_ALERT_CAT_UUID ),\n            . access_cb   =   gatt_svr_chr_access_alert ,\n            . flags   =   BLE_GATT_CHR_F_READ ,\n        }, {\n            . uuid128   =   BLE_UUID16 ( GATT_SVR_CHR_NEW_ALERT ),\n            . access_cb   =   gatt_svr_chr_access_alert ,\n            . flags   =   BLE_GATT_CHR_F_NOTIFY ,\n        }, {\n            . uuid128   =   BLE_UUID16 ( GATT_SVR_CHR_SUP_UNR_ALERT_CAT_UUID ),\n            . access_cb   =   gatt_svr_chr_access_alert ,\n            . flags   =   BLE_GATT_CHR_F_READ ,\n        }, {\n            . uuid128   =   BLE_UUID16 ( GATT_SVR_CHR_UNR_ALERT_STAT_UUID ),\n            . access_cb   =   gatt_svr_chr_access_alert ,\n            . flags   =   BLE_GATT_CHR_F_NOTIFY ,\n        }, {\n            . uuid128   =   BLE_UUID16 ( GATT_SVR_CHR_ALERT_NOT_CTRL_PT ),\n            . access_cb   =   gatt_svr_chr_access_alert ,\n            . flags   =   BLE_GATT_CHR_F_WRITE ,\n        }, {              0 ,  /* No more characteristics in this service. */          } },\n    },\n\n    {          0 ,  /* No more services. */      },",

There are two alternative methods  bleprph  could have used to\naccomplish this task:   Map characteristics to ATT handles during service registration; use the  attr_handle  parameter as a key into this table during characteristic access.  Implement a dedicated function for each characteristic; each function inherently knows which characteristic it corresponds to.   All the GAP service characteristics have 16-bit UUIDs, so this function uses\nthe  ble_uuid_128_to_16()  function to convert the 128-bit UUID to its\ncorresponding 16-bit UUID.  This conversion function returns the corresponding\n16-bit UUID on success, or 0 on failure.  Success is asserted here to ensure\nthe NimBLE stack is doing its job properly; the stack should only call this\nfunction for accesses to characteristics that it is registered with, and all\nGAP service characteristics have valid 16-bit UUIDs.",

The assert()  here is another case of making sure the NimBLE stack is doing its\njob; this characteristic was registered as read-only, so the stack should have\nprevented write accesses.  To fulfill a characteristic read request, the application needs to assign the ctxt- chr_access.data  field to point to the attribute data to respond with,\nand fill the  ctxt- chr_access.len  field with the length of the attribute data. bleprph  stores the device name in read-only memory as follows:   const   char   *bleprph_device_name   =   nimble-bleprph ;  The cast to pointer-to-void is a necessary annoyance to remove the  const \nqualifier from the device name variable.  You will need to \"cast away const\"\nwhenever you respond to read requests with read-only data.  It is not shown in the above snippet, but this function ultimately returns 0.\nBy returning 0,  bleprph  indicates that the characteristic data in ctxt- chr_access  is valid and that NimBLE should include it in its response\nto the peer.   A word of warning:  The attribute data that  ctxt- chr_access.data  points to\nmust remain valid after the access function returns, as the NimBLE stack needs\nto use it to form a GATT read response.  In other words, you must not\nallocate the characteristic value data on the stack of the access function.\nTwo characteristic accesses never occur at the same time, so it is OK to use\nthe same memory for repeated accesses.",

This\ncharacteristic was registered as write-only, so the  assert()  here is just a\nsafety precaution to ensure the NimBLE stack is doing its job.  For writes, the roles of the  ctxt- chr_access.data  and  ctxt- chr_access.len \nfields are the reverse of the read case.  The NimBLE stack uses these fields to\nindicate the data written by the peer.  Many characteristics have strict length requirements for write operations.\nThis characteristic has such a restriction; if the written data is not a 48-bit\nBR address, the application tells NimBLE to respond with an invalid attribute\nvalue length error.  For writes, the  ctxt- chr_access.data  pointer is only valid for the duration\nof the access function.  If the application needs to save the written data, it\nshould store it elsewhere before the function returns.

You can immediately resume advertising if you want to allow another central to connect, but you will need to do so explicitly by calling  ble_gap_adv_start()  again.  Also, be aware NimBLE's default configuration only allows a single connection at a time.  NimBLE supports multiple concurrent connections, but you must configure it to do so first.",

A\nconnection callback is a bit of application code which NimBLE uses to inform\nyou of connection-related events.  For example, if a connection is terminated,\nNimBLE lets you know about it with a call to that connection's callback.\n\n\nIn the \nadvertising section\n of this tutorial, we saw how the\napplication specifies a connection callback when it begins advertising.  NimBLE\nuses this callback to notify the application that a central has connected to\nyour peripheral after receiving an advertisement.  Let's revisit how \nbleprph\n specifies its connection callback when advertising:\n\n\n\n\n    \n/* Begin advertising. */\n\n    \nrc\n \n=\n \nble_gap_adv_start\n(\nBLE_GAP_DISC_MODE_GEN\n, \nBLE_GAP_CONN_MODE_UND\n,\n                           \nNULL\n, \n0\n, \nNULL\n, \nbleprph_on_connect\n, \nNULL\n);\n    \nif\n (\nrc\n \n!=\n \n0\n) {\n        \nBLEPRPH_LOG\n(\nERROR\n, \nerror enabling advertisement; rc=%d\\n\n, \nrc\n);\n        \nreturn\n;\n    }\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nbleprph_on_connect()\n\n\nThe \nbleprph_on_connect()\n function is \nbleprph\n's connection callback; NimBLE\ncalls this function when the advertising operation leads to connection\nestablishment.  Upon connecting, this callback becomes permanently associated\nwith the connection; all subsequent events related to this connection are\ncommunicated through this callback.\n\n\nNow let's look at the function that \nbleprph\n uses for all its connection\ncallbacks: \nbleprph_on_connect()\n.\n\n\nstatic\n \nint\n\n\nbleprph_on_connect\n(\nint\n \nevent\n, \nint\n \nstatus\n, \nstruct\n \nble_gap_conn_ctxt\n \n*ctxt\n,\n                   \nvoid\n \n*arg\n)\n{\n    \nswitch\n (\nevent\n) {\n    \ncase\n \nBLE_GAP_EVENT_CONN\n:\n        \nBLEPRPH_LOG\n(\nINFO\n, \nconnection %s; status=%d \n,\n                    \nstatus\n \n==\n \n0\n \n?\n \nup\n \n:\n \ndown\n, \nstatus\n);\n        \nbleprph_print_conn_desc\n(\nctxt-\ndesc\n);\n        \nBLEPRPH_LOG\n(\nINFO\n, \n\\n\n);\n\n        \nif\n (\nstatus\n \n!=\n \n0\n) {\n            \n/* Connection terminated; resume advertising. */\n\n            \nbleprph_advertise\n();\n        }\n        \nbreak\n;\n    }\n\n    \nreturn\n \n0\n;\n}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConnection callbacks are used to communicate a variety of events related to a\nconnection.  An application determines the type of event that occurred by\ninspecting the value of the \nevent\n parameter.  The full list of event codes\ncan be found in \nnet/nimble/host/include/host/ble_gatt.h\n.\n\nbleprph\n only concerns itself with a single event type: \nBLE_GAP_EVENT_CONN\n.\nThis event indicates that a new connection has been established, or an existing\nconnection has been terminated; the \nstatus\n parameter clarifies which.  As you\ncan see, \nbleprph\n uses the \nstatus\n parameter to determine if it should resume\nadvertising.\n\n\nThe \nctxt\n parameter contains additional information about the connection\nevent.  \nbleprph\n does nothing more than log some fields of this struct, but\nsome apps will likely want to perform further actions, e.g., perform service\ndiscovery on the connected device.  The \nstruct ble_gap_conn_ctxt\n type is\ndefined as follows:\n\n\nstruct\n \nble_gap_conn_ctxt\n {\n    \nstruct\n \nble_gap_conn_desc\n \n*desc\n;\n\n    \nunion\n {\n        \nstruct\n {\n            \nstruct\n \nble_gap_upd_params\n \n*self_params\n;\n            \nstruct\n \nble_gap_upd_params\n \n*peer_params\n;\n        } \nupdate\n;\n\n        \nstruct\n \nble_gap_sec_params\n \n*sec_params\n;\n    };\n};\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs shown, a connection context object consists of two parts:\n\n\n\n\ndesc:\n The connection descriptor; indicates properties of the connection.\n\n\nanonymous union:\n The contents are event-specific; check the \nevent\n code to determine which member field (if any) is relevant.\n\n\n\n\nFor events of type \nBLE_GAP_EVENT_CONN\n, the anonymous union is not used at all, so the only information carried by the context struct is the connection descriptor.  The \nstruct ble_gap_conn_desc\n type is defined as follows:\n\n\nstruct\n \nble_gap_conn_desc\n {\n    \nuint8_t\n \npeer_addr\n[\n6\n];\n    \nuint16_t\n \nconn_handle\n;\n    \nuint16_t\n \nconn_itvl\n;\n    \nuint16_t\n \nconn_latency\n;\n    \nuint16_t\n \nsupervision_timeout\n;\n    \nuint8_t\n \npeer_addr_type\n;\n};\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe will examine these fields in a slightly different order from how they appear\nin the struct definition.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nField\n\n\nPurpose\n\n\nNotes\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\npeer_addr\n\n\nThe 48-bit address of the peer device.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\npeer_addr_type\n\n\nWhether the peer is using a public or random address.\n\n\nThe address type list is documented in \nnet/nimble/include/nimble/hci_common.h\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nconn_handle\n\n\nThe 16-bit handle associated with this connection.\n\n\nThis number is how your app and the NimBLE stack refer to this connection.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nconn_itvl,\nconn_latency,\nsupervision_timeout\n\n\nLow-level properties of the connection.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGuarantees\n\n\nIt is important to know what your application code is allowed to do from within\na connection callback.\n\n\nNo restrictions on NimBLE operations\n\n\nYour app is free to make calls into the NimBLE stack from within a connection\ncallback.  \nbleprph\n takes advantage of this freedom when it resumes\nadvertising upon connection termination.

Modify the call to  ble_gap_adv_start()  such that the device is non-discoverable and non-connectable.    static   void  bleprph_advertise ( void )\n{      uint8_t   uuid128 [ 16 ];      int   rc ;      /* Arbitrarily et the UUID to a string of 0x11 bytes. */       memset ( uuid128 ,  0x11 ,  sizeof   uuid128 );       /* Major version=2; minor version=10. */       rc   =   ble_ibeacon_set_adv_data ( uuid128 ,  2 ,  10 );      if  ( rc   !=   0 ) {\n         BLEPRPH_LOG ( ERROR ,  error setting iBeacon advertisement data; rc=%d\\n ,\n                     rc );\n         return ;\n    }\n\n     /* Begin advertising. */       rc   =   ble_gap_adv_start ( BLE_GAP_DISC_MODE_NON ,  BLE_GAP_CONN_MODE_NON ,                             NULL ,  0 ,  NULL ,  bleprph_on_connect ,  NULL );\n     if  ( rc   !=   0 ) {\n         BLEPRPH_LOG ( ERROR ,  error enabling advertisement; rc=%d\\n ,  rc );\n         return ;\n    }\n}  Now when you run this app on your board, you should be able to see it with all\nyour iBeacon-aware devices.",

            "text": "Mynewt Core OS\n\n\nThe Mynewt Core OS is a multitasking, preemptive real-time operating system combining a scheduler with typical RTOS features such as mutexes, semaphores, memory pools, etc. The Mynewt Core OS also provides a number of useful utilities such as a task watchdog, networking stack memory buffers and time management API. Each of these features is described in detail in its own section of the manual.\n\n\nA multitasking, preemptive operating system is one in which a number of different tasks can be instantiated and assigned a priority, with higher priority tasks running before lower priority tasks. Furthermore, if a lower priority task is running and a higher priority task wants to run, the lower priority task is halted and the higher priority task is allowed to run. In other words, the lower priority task is preempted by the higher priority task.\n\n\nWhy use an OS?\n\n\nYou may ask yourself \"why do I need a multitasking preemptive OS\"? The answer may indeed be that you do not. Some applications are simple and only require a polling loop. Others are more complex and may require that certain jobs are executed in a timely manner or before other jobs are executed. If you have a simple polling loop, you cannot move on to service a job until the current job is done being serviced. With the Mynewt OS, the application developer need not worry about certain jobs taking too long or not executing in a timely fashion; the OS provides mechanisms to deal with these situations. Another benefit of using an OS is that it helps shield application developers from other application code being written; the developer does not have to worry (or has to worry less) about other application code behaving badly and causing undesirable behavior or preventing their code from executing properly. Other benefits of using an OS (and the Mynewt OS in particular) is that it also provides features that the developer would otherwise need to create on his/her own. \n\n\nCore OS Features\n\n\n\n\n\n\nScheduler/context switching\n\n\nTime\n\n\nTasks\n\n\nEvent queues/callouts\n\n\nSemaphores\n\n\nMutexes\n\n\nMemory pools\n\n\nHeap\n\n\nMbufs\n\n\nSanity\n\n\nCallouts\n\n\nPorting OS to other platforms\n\n\n\n\nBasic OS Application Creation\n\n\nCreating an application using the Mynewt Core OS is a relatively simple task: once you have installed the basic Newt Tool structure (build structure) for your application and created your BSP (Board Support Package), the developer initializes the OS by calling \nos_init()\n, performs application specific initializations, and then starts the os by calling \nos_start()\n. \n\n\nThe \nos_init()\n API performs two basic functions: calls architecture and bsp specific setup and initializes the idle task of the OS. This is required before the OS is started. The OS start API initializes the OS time tick interrupt and starts the highest priority task running (i.e starts the scheduler). Note that \nos_start()\n never returns; once called the device is either running in an application task context or in idle task context.\n\n\nInitializing application modules and tasks can get somewhat complicated with RTOS's similar to Mynewt. Care must be taken that the API provided by a task are initialized prior to being called by another (higher priority) task. \n\n\nFor example, take a simple application with two tasks (tasks 1 and 2, with task 1 higher priority than task 2). Task 2 provides an API which has a semaphore lock and this semaphore is initialized by task 2 when the task handler for task 2 is called. Task 1 is expected to call this API.\n\n\nConsider the sequence of events when the OS is started. The scheduler starts running and picks the highest priority task (task 1 in this case). The task handler function for task 1 is called and will keep running until it yields execution. Before yielding, code in the task 1 handler function calls the API provided by task 2. The semaphore being accessed in the task 2 API has yet to be initialized since the task 2 handler function has not had a chance to run! This will lead to undesirable behavior and will need to be addressed by the application developer. Note that the Mynewt OS does guard against internal API being called before the OS has started (they will return error) but it does not safeguard application defined objects from access prior to initialization.\n\n\nExample\n\n\nOne way to avoid initialization issues like the one described above is to perform task initializations prior to starting the OS. The code example shown below illustrates this concept. The application initializes the OS, calls an application specific \"task initialization\" function, and then starts the OS. The application task initialization function is responsible for initializing all the data objects that each task exposes to the other tasks. The tasks themselves are also initialized at this time (by calling \nos_task_init()\n). \n\n\nIn the example, each task works in a ping-pong like fashion: task 1 wakes up, adds a token to semaphore 1 and then waits for a token from semaphore 2.

Each of these features is described in detail in its own section of the manual.  A multitasking, preemptive operating system is one in which a number of different tasks can be instantiated and assigned a priority, with higher priority tasks running before lower priority tasks. Furthermore, if a lower priority task is running and a higher priority task wants to run, the lower priority task is halted and the higher priority task is allowed to run. In other words, the lower priority task is preempted by the higher priority task.",

Others are more complex and may require that certain jobs are executed in a timely manner or before other jobs are executed. If you have a simple polling loop, you cannot move on to service a job until the current job is done being serviced. With the Mynewt OS, the application developer need not worry about certain jobs taking too long or not executing in a timely fashion; the OS provides mechanisms to deal with these situations. Another benefit of using an OS is that it helps shield application developers from other application code being written; the developer does not have to worry (or has to worry less) about other application code behaving badly and causing undesirable behavior or preventing their code from executing properly. Other benefits of using an OS (and the Mynewt OS in particular) is that it also provides features that the developer would otherwise need to create on his/her own.",

            "text": "Creating an application using the Mynewt Core OS is a relatively simple task: once you have installed the basic Newt Tool structure (build structure) for your application and created your BSP (Board Support Package), the developer initializes the OS by calling  os_init() , performs application specific initializations, and then starts the os by calling  os_start() .   The  os_init()  API performs two basic functions: calls architecture and bsp specific setup and initializes the idle task of the OS. This is required before the OS is started. The OS start API initializes the OS time tick interrupt and starts the highest priority task running (i.e starts the scheduler). Note that  os_start()  never returns; once called the device is either running in an application task context or in idle task context.  Initializing application modules and tasks can get somewhat complicated with RTOS's similar to Mynewt. Care must be taken that the API provided by a task are initialized prior to being called by another (higher priority) task.   For example, take a simple application with two tasks (tasks 1 and 2, with task 1 higher priority than task 2). Task 2 provides an API which has a semaphore lock and this semaphore is initialized by task 2 when the task handler for task 2 is called. Task 1 is expected to call this API.  Consider the sequence of events when the OS is started. The scheduler starts running and picks the highest priority task (task 1 in this case). The task handler function for task 1 is called and will keep running until it yields execution. Before yielding, code in the task 1 handler function calls the API provided by task 2. The semaphore being accessed in the task 2 API has yet to be initialized since the task 2 handler function has not had a chance to run! This will lead to undesirable behavior and will need to be addressed by the application developer. Note that the Mynewt OS does guard against internal API being called before the OS has started (they will return error) but it does not safeguard application defined objects from access prior to initialization.",

The tasks themselves are also initialized at this time (by calling  os_task_init() ).   In the example, each task works in a ping-pong like fashion: task 1 wakes up, adds a token to semaphore 1 and then waits for a token from semaphore 2.

            "text": "Task\n\n\nA task, along with the scheduler, forms the basis of the Mynewt OS. A task \nconsists of two basic elements: a task stack and a task function. The task \nfunction is basically a forever loop, waiting for some \"event\" to wake it up. \nThere are two methods used to signal a task that it has work to do: event queues \nand semaphores (see the appropriate manual sections for descriptions of these \nfeatures).\n\n\nThe Mynewt OS is a multi-tasking, preemptive OS. Every task is assigned a task \npriority (from 0 to 255), with 0 being the highest priority task. If a higher \npriority task than the current task wants to run, the scheduler preempts the \ncurrently running task and switches context to the higher priority task. This is \njust a fancy way of saying that the processor stack pointer now points to the \nstack of the higher priority task and the task resumes execution where it left \noff.\n\n\nTasks run to completion unless they are preempted by a higher priority task. The \ndeveloper must insure that tasks eventually \"sleep\"; otherwise lower priority \ntasks will never get a chance to run (actually, any task lower in priority than \nthe task that never sleeps). A task will be put to sleep in the following cases: \nit puts itself to sleep using \nos_time_delay()\n, it waits on an event queue \nwhich is empty or attempts to obtain a mutex or a semaphore that is currently \nowned by another task.\n\n\nNote that other sections of the manual describe these OS features in more \ndetail.\n\n\nDescription\n\n\nIn order to create a task two data structures need to be defined: the task \nobject (struct os_task) and its associated stack. Determining the stack size can \nbe a bit tricky; generally developers should not declare large local variables \non the stack so that task stacks can be of limited size. However, all \napplications are different and the developer must choose the stack size \naccordingly. NOTE: be careful when declaring your stack! The stack is in units \nof \nos_stack_t\n sized elements (generally 32-bits). Looking at the example given \nbelow and assuming \nos_stack_t\n is defined to be a 32-bit unsigned value, \n\"my_task_stack\" will use 256 bytes. \n\n\nA task must also have an associated \"task function\". This is the function that \nwill be called when the task is first run. This task function should never \nreturn!\n\n\nIn order to inform the Mynewt OS of the new task and to have it added to the \nscheduler, the \nos_task_init()\n function is called. Once \nos_task_init()\n is \ncalled, the task is made ready to run and is added to the active task list. Note \nthat a task can be initialized (started) before or after the os has started \n(i.e. before \nos_start()\n is called) but must be initialized after the os has \nbeen initialized (i.e. 'os_init' has been called). In most of the examples and \ncurrent Mynewt projects, the os is initialized, tasks are initialized, and the \nthe os is started. Once the os has started, the highest priority task will be \nthe first task set to run.\n\n\nInformation about a task can be obtained using the \nos_task_info_get_next()\n \nAPI. Developers can walk the list of tasks to obtain information on all created \ntasks. This information is of type \nos_task_info\n and is described below.\n\n\nThe following is a very simple example showing a single application task.

            "text": "A task, along with the scheduler, forms the basis of the Mynewt OS. A task \nconsists of two basic elements: a task stack and a task function. The task \nfunction is basically a forever loop, waiting for some \"event\" to wake it up. \nThere are two methods used to signal a task that it has work to do: event queues \nand semaphores (see the appropriate manual sections for descriptions of these \nfeatures).  The Mynewt OS is a multi-tasking, preemptive OS. Every task is assigned a task \npriority (from 0 to 255), with 0 being the highest priority task. If a higher \npriority task than the current task wants to run, the scheduler preempts the \ncurrently running task and switches context to the higher priority task. This is \njust a fancy way of saying that the processor stack pointer now points to the \nstack of the higher priority task and the task resumes execution where it left \noff.  Tasks run to completion unless they are preempted by a higher priority task. The \ndeveloper must insure that tasks eventually \"sleep\"; otherwise lower priority \ntasks will never get a chance to run (actually, any task lower in priority than \nthe task that never sleeps). A task will be put to sleep in the following cases: \nit puts itself to sleep using  os_time_delay() , it waits on an event queue \nwhich is empty or attempts to obtain a mutex or a semaphore that is currently \nowned by another task.  Note that other sections of the manual describe these OS features in more \ndetail.",

            "text": "In order to create a task two data structures need to be defined: the task \nobject (struct os_task) and its associated stack. Determining the stack size can \nbe a bit tricky; generally developers should not declare large local variables \non the stack so that task stacks can be of limited size. However, all \napplications are different and the developer must choose the stack size \naccordingly. NOTE: be careful when declaring your stack! The stack is in units \nof  os_stack_t  sized elements (generally 32-bits). Looking at the example given \nbelow and assuming  os_stack_t  is defined to be a 32-bit unsigned value, \n\"my_task_stack\" will use 256 bytes.   A task must also have an associated \"task function\". This is the function that \nwill be called when the task is first run. This task function should never \nreturn!  In order to inform the Mynewt OS of the new task and to have it added to the \nscheduler, the  os_task_init()  function is called. Once  os_task_init()  is \ncalled, the task is made ready to run and is added to the active task list. Note \nthat a task can be initialized (started) before or after the os has started \n(i.e. before  os_start()  is called) but must be initialized after the os has \nbeen initialized (i.e. 'os_init' has been called). In most of the examples and \ncurrent Mynewt projects, the os is initialized, tasks are initialized, and the \nthe os is started. Once the os has started, the highest priority task will be \nthe first task set to run.  Information about a task can be obtained using the  os_task_info_get_next()  \nAPI. Developers can walk the list of tasks to obtain information on all created \ntasks. This information is of type  os_task_info  and is described below.  The following is a very simple example showing a single application task. This \ntask simply toggles an LED at a one second interval.  /* Create a simple  project  with a task that blinks a LED every second */  /* Define task stack and task object */  #define MY_TASK_PRI         (OS_TASK_PRI_HIGHEST)   #define MY_STACK_SIZE       (64)   struct   os_task   my_task ;  os_stack_t   my_task_stack [ MY_STACK_SIZE ];  /* This is the task function */  void   my_task_func ( void   *arg ) {\n     /* Set the led pin as an output */ \n     hal_gpio_init_out ( LED_BLINK_PIN ,  1 );\n\n     /* The task is a forever loop that does not return */ \n     while  ( 1 ) {\n         /* Wait one second */  \n         os_time_delay ( 1000 );\n\n         /* Toggle the LED */  \n         hal_gpio_toggle ( LED_BLINK_PIN );\n    }\n} /* This is the main function for the project */  int   main ( void ) {\n     int   rc ;\n\n     /* Initialize OS */ \n     os_init ();\n\n     /* Initialize the task */ \n     os_task_init ( my_task ,  my_task ,  my_task_func ,  NULL ,  MY_TASK_PRIO , \n                  OS_WAIT_FOREVER ,  my_task_stack ,  MY_STACK_SIZE );\n\n     /* Start the OS */ \n     os_start ();\n\n     /* os start should never return.

Semaphores like the ones used by the myNewt OS are called \"counting\" semaphores as they are allowed to have more than one token (explained below).\n\n\nDescription\n\n\nA semaphore is a fairly simple construct consisting of a queue for waiting tasks and the number of tokens currently owned by the semaphore. A semaphore can be obtained as long as there are tokens in the semaphore. Any task can add tokens to the semaphore and any task can request the semaphore, thereby removing tokens. When creating the semaphore, the initial number of tokens can be set as well.\n\n\nWhen used for exclusive access to a shared resource the semaphore only needs a single token. In this case, a single task \"creates\" the semaphore by calling \nos_sem_init\n with a value of one (1) for the token. When a task desires exclusive access to the shared resource it requests the semaphore by calling \nos_sem_pend\n. If there is a token the requesting task will acquire the semaphore and continue operation. If no tokens are available the task will be put to sleep until there is a token. A common \"problem\" with using a semaphore for exclusive access is called \npriority inversion\n. Consider the following scenario: a high and low priority task both share a resource which is locked using a semaphore. If the low priority task obtains the semaphore and then the high priority task requests the semaphore, the high priority task is now blocked until the low priority task releases the semaphore. Now suppose that there are tasks between the low priority task and the high priority task that want to run. These tasks will preempt the low priority task which owns the semaphore. Thus, the high priority task is blocked waiting for the low priority task to finish using the semaphore but the low priority task cannot run since other tasks are running. Thus, the high priority tasks is \"inverted\" in priority; in effect running at a much lower priority as normally it would preempt the other (lower priority) tasks. If this is an issue a mutex should be used instead of a semaphore.\n\n\nSemaphores can also be used for task synchronization. A simple example of this would be the following. A task creates a semaphore and initializes it with no tokens. The task then waits on the semaphore, and since there are no tokens, the task is put to sleep. When other tasks want to wake up the sleeping task they simply add a token by calling \nos_sem_release\n. This will cause the sleeping task to wake up (instantly if no other higher priority tasks want to run).\n\n\nThe other common use of a counting semaphore is in what is commonly called a \"producer/consumer\" relationship. The producer adds tokens (by calling \nos_sem_release\n) and the consumer consumes them by calling \nos_sem_pend\n. In this relationship, the producer has work for the consumer to do. Each token added to the semaphore will cause the consumer to do whatever work is required. A simple example could be the following: every time a button is pressed there is some work to do (ring a bell). Each button press causes the producer to add a token. Each token consumed rings the bell. There will exactly the same number of bell rings as there are button presses. In other words, each call to \nos_sem_pend\n subtracts exactly one token and each call to \nos_sem_release\n adds exactly one token.\n\n\nData structures\n\n\nstruct\n \nos_sem\n\n{\n    \nSLIST_HEAD\n(, \nos_task\n) \nsem_head\n;     \n/* chain of waiting tasks */\n\n    \nuint16_t\n    \n_pad\n;\n    \nuint16_t\n    \nsem_tokens\n;             \n/* # of tokens */\n\n};\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nElement\n\n\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nsem_head\n\n\nQueue head for list of tasks waiting on semaphore\n\n\n\n\n\n\n_pad\n\n\nPadding for alignment\n\n\n\n\n\n\nsem_tokens\n\n\nCurrent number of tokens\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nList of Functions\n\n\nThe functions available in semaphore are:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFunction\n\n\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nos_sem_init\n\n\nInitialize a semaphore with a given number of tokens.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nos_sem_pend\n\n\nWait for a semaphore for a given amount of time.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nos_sem_release\n\n\nRelease a semaphore that you are holding.

A mutex provides \npriority inheritance\n in order to prevent \npriority inversion\n. Priority inversion occurs when a higher priority task is waiting on a resource owned by a lower priority task. Using a mutex, the lower priority task will inherit the highest priority of any task waiting on the mutex. \n\n\nDescription\n\n\nThe first order of business when using a mutex is to declare the mutex globally. The mutex needs to be initialized before it is used (see the examples). It is generally a good idea to initialize the mutex before tasks start running in order to avoid a task possibly using the mutex before it is initialized.\n\n\nWhen a task wants exclusive access to a shared resource it needs to obtain the mutex by calling \nos_mutex_pend\n. If the mutex is currently owned by a different task (a lower priority task), the requesting task will be put to sleep and the owners priority will be elevated to the priority of the requesting task. Note that multiple tasks can request ownership and the current owner is elevated to the highest priority of any task waitin on the mutex. When the task is done using the shared resource, it needs to release the mutex by called \nos_mutex_release\n. There needs to be one release per call to pend. Note that nested calls to \nos_mutex_pend\n are allowed but there needs to be one release per pend.\n\n\nThe following example will illustrate how priority inheritance works. In this example, the task number is the same as its priority. Remember that the lower the number, the higher the priority (i.e. priority 0 is higher priority than priority 1). Suppose that task 5 gets ownership of a mutex but is preempted by task 4. Task 4 attempts to gain ownership of the mutex but cannot as it is owned by task 5. Task 4 is put to sleep and task 5 is temporarily raised to priority 4. Before task 5 can release the mutex, task 3 runs and attempts to acquire the mutex. At this point, both task 3 and task 4 are waiting on the mutex (sleeping). Task 5 now runs at priority 3 (the highest priority of all the tasks waiting on the mutex). When task 5 finally releases the mutex it will be preempted as two higher priority tasks are waiting for it. \n\n\nNote that when multiple tasks are waiting on a mutex owned by another task, once the mutex is released the highest priority task waiting on the mutex is run. \n\n\nData structures\n\n\nstruct\n \nos_mutex\n\n{\n    \nSLIST_HEAD\n(, \nos_task\n) \nmu_head\n;\n    \nuint8_t\n     \n_pad\n;\n    \nuint8_t\n     \nmu_prio\n;\n    \nuint16_t\n    \nmu_level\n;\n    \nstruct\n \nos_task\n \n*mu_owner\n;\n};\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nElement\n\n\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nmu_head\n\n\nQueue head for list of tasks waiting on mutex\n\n\n\n\n\n\n_pad\n\n\nPadding\n\n\n\n\n\n\nmu_prio\n\n\nDefault priority of owner of mutex.

It is generally a good idea to initialize the mutex before tasks start running in order to avoid a task possibly using the mutex before it is initialized.  When a task wants exclusive access to a shared resource it needs to obtain the mutex by calling  os_mutex_pend . If the mutex is currently owned by a different task (a lower priority task), the requesting task will be put to sleep and the owners priority will be elevated to the priority of the requesting task. Note that multiple tasks can request ownership and the current owner is elevated to the highest priority of any task waitin on the mutex. When the task is done using the shared resource, it needs to release the mutex by called  os_mutex_release . There needs to be one release per call to pend. Note that nested calls to  os_mutex_pend  are allowed but there needs to be one release per pend.  The following example will illustrate how priority inheritance works. In this example, the task number is the same as its priority. Remember that the lower the number, the higher the priority (i.e. priority 0 is higher priority than priority 1). Suppose that task 5 gets ownership of a mutex but is preempted by task 4. Task 4 attempts to gain ownership of the mutex but cannot as it is owned by task 5. Task 4 is put to sleep and task 5 is temporarily raised to priority 4. Before task 5 can release the mutex, task 3 runs and attempts to acquire the mutex. At this point, both task 3 and task 4 are waiting on the mutex (sleeping). Task 5 now runs at priority 3 (the highest priority of all the tasks waiting on the mutex). When task 5 finally releases the mutex it will be preempted as two higher priority tasks are waiting for it.   Note that when multiple tasks are waiting on a mutex owned by another task, once the mutex is released the highest priority task waiting on the mutex is run.",

Generally, memory pools are used when the developer wants to allocate a certain amount of memory to a given feature. Unlike the heap, where a code module is at the mercy of other code modules to insure there is sufficient memory, memory pools can insure sufficient memory allocation.\n\n\nDescription\n\n\nIn order to create a memory pool the developer needs to do a few things.

The alignment size definition is named \nOS_ALIGNMENT\n and can be found in os_arch.h as it is architecture specific. The memory block alignment is usually for efficiency but may be due to other reasons. Generally, blocks are aligned on 32-bit boundaries.

The first macro returns the number of bytes needed for the memory pool while the second returns the number of \nos_membuf_t\n elements required by the memory pool.

            "text": "Mbufs\n\n\nThe mbuf (short for memory buffer) is a common concept in networking stacks. The mbuf is used to hold packet data as it traverses the stack. The mbuf also generally stores header information or other networking stack information that is carried around with the packet. The mbuf and its associated library of functions were developed to make common networking stack operations (like stripping and adding protocol headers) efficient and as copy-free as possible.\n\n\nIn its simplest form, an mbuf is a memory block with some space reserved for internal information and a pointer which is used to \"chain\" memory blocks together in order to create a \"packet\". This is a very important aspect of the mbuf: the ability to chain mbufs together to create larger \"packets\" (chains of mbufs).\n\n\nWhy use mbufs?\n\n\nThe main reason is to conserve memory. Consider a networking protocol that generally sends small packets but occasionally sends large ones. The Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) protocol is one such example. A flat buffer would need to be sized so that the maximum packet size could be contained by the buffer. With the mbuf, a number of mbufs can be chained together so that the occasional large packet can be handled while leaving more packet buffers available to the networking stack for smaller packets.\n\n\nPacket Header mbuf\n\n\nNot all mbufs are created equal. The first mbuf in a chain of mbufs is a special mbuf called a \"packet header mbuf\". The reason that this mbuf is special is that it contains the length of all the data contained by the chain of mbufs (the packet length, in other words). The packet header mbuf may also contain a user defined structure (called a \"user header\") so that networking protocol specific information can be conveyed to various layers of the networking stack. Any mbufs that are part of the packet (i.e. in the mbuf chain but not the first one) are \"normal\" (i.e. non-packet header) mbufs. A normal mbuf does not have any packet header or user packet header structures in them; they only contain the basic mbuf header (\nstruct os_mbuf\n). Figure 1 illustrates these two types of mbufs. Note that the numbers/text in parentheses denote the size of the structures/elements (in bytes) and that MBLEN is the memory block length of the memory pool used by the mbuf pool.\n\n\n\n\nNormal mbuf\n\n\nNow let's take a deeper dive into the mbuf structure. Figure 2 illustrates a normal mbuf and breaks out the various fields in the \nos_mbuf\n structure. \n\n\n\n\nThe \nom_data\n field is a pointer to where the data starts inside the data buffer. Typically, mbufs that are allocated from the mbuf pool (discussed later) have their om_data pointer set to the start of the data buffer but there are cases where this may not be desirable (added a protocol header to a packet, for example). \n\n\nThe \nom_flags\n field is a set of flags used internally by the mbuf library. Currently, no flags have been defined. \n\n\nThe \nom_pkthdr_len\n field is the total length of all packet headers in the mbuf. For normal mbufs this is set to 0 as there is no packet or user packet headers. For packet header mbufs, this would be set to the length of the packet header structure (16) plus the size of the user packet header (if any). Note that it is this field which differentiates packet header mbufs from normal mbufs (i.e. if \nom_pkthdr_len\n is zero, this is a normal mbuf; otherwise it is a packet header mbuf). \n\n\nThe \nom_len\n field contains the amount of user data in the data buffer. When initially allocated, this field is 0 as there is no user data in the mbuf. \n\n\nThe \nomp_pool\n field is a pointer to the pool from which this mbuf has been allocated. This is used internally by the mbuf library. \n\n\nThe \nomp_next\n field is a linked list element which is used to chain mbufs.\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2 also shows a normal mbuf with actual values in the \nos_mbuf\n structure. This mbuf starts at address 0x1000 and is 256 bytes in total length. In this example, the user has copied 33 bytes into the data buffer starting at address 0x1010 (this is where om_data points). Note that the packet header length in this mbuf is 0 as it is not a packet header mbuf.\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3 illustrates the packet header mbuf along with some chained mbufs (i.e a \"packet\"). In this example, the user header structure is defined to be 8 bytes. Note that in figure 3 we show a number of different mbufs with varying \nom_data\n pointers and lengths since we want to show various examples of valid mbufs. For all the mbufs (both packet header and normal ones) the total length of the memory block is 128 bytes.\n\n\n\n\nMbuf pools\n\n\nMbufs are collected into \"mbuf pools\" much like memory blocks. The mbuf pool itself contains a pointer to a memory pool. The memory blocks in this memory pool are the actual mbufs; both normal and packet header mbufs. Thus, the memory block (and corresponding memory pool) must be sized correctly. In other words, the memory blocks which make up the memory pool used by the mbuf pool must be at least: sizeof(struct os_mbuf) + sizeof(struct os_mbuf_pkthdr) + sizeof(struct user_defined_header) + desired minimum data buffer length. For example, if the developer wants mbufs to contain at least 64 bytes of user data and they have a user header of 12 bytes, the size of the memory block would be (at least): 64 + 12 + 16 + 8, or 100 bytes. Yes, this is a fair amount of overhead. However, the flexibility provided by the mbuf library usually outweighs overhead concerns.\n\n\nCreate mbuf pool\n\n\nCreating an mbuf pool is fairly simple: create a memory pool and then create the mbuf pool using that memory pool. Once the developer has determined the size of the user data needed per mbuf (this is based on the application/networking stack and is outside the scope of this discussion) and the size of the user header (if any), the memory blocks can be sized. In the example shown below, the application requires 64 bytes of user data per mbuf and also allocates a user header (called struct user_hdr). Note that we do not show the user header data structure as there really is no need; all we need to do is to account for it when creating the memory pool. In the example, we use the macro \nMBUF_PKTHDR_OVERHEAD\n to denote the amount of packet header overhead per mbuf and \nMBUF_MEMBLOCK_OVERHEAD\n to denote the total amount of overhead required per memory block. The macro \nMBUF_BUF_SIZE\n is used to denote the amount of payload that the application requires (aligned on a 32-bit boundary in this case). All this leads to the total memory block size required, denoted by the macro \nMBUF_MEMBLOCK_OVERHEAD\n.\n\n\n#define MBUF_PKTHDR_OVERHEAD    sizeof(struct os_mbuf_pkthdr) + sizeof(struct user_hdr)\n\n\n#define MBUF_MEMBLOCK_OVERHEAD  sizeof(struct os_mbuf) + MBUF_PKTHDR_OVERHEAD\n\n\n\n#define MBUF_NUM_MBUFS      (32)\n\n\n#define MBUF_PAYLOAD_SIZE   (64)\n\n\n#define MBUF_BUF_SIZE       OS_ALIGN(MBUF_PAYLOAD_SIZE, 4)\n\n\n#define MBUF_MEMBLOCK_SIZE  (MBUF_BUF_SIZE + MBUF_MEMBLOCK_OVERHEAD)\n\n\n#define MBUF_MEMPOOL_SIZE   OS_MEMPOOL_SIZE(MBUF_NUM_MBUFS, MBUF_MEMBLOCK_SIZE)\n\n\n\nstruct\n \nos_mbuf_pool\n \ng_mbuf_pool\n; \n\nstruct\n \nos_mempool\n \ng_mbuf_mempool\n;\n\nos_membuf_t\n \ng_mbuf_buffer\n[\nMBUF_MEMPOOL_SIZE\n];\n\n\nvoid\n\n\ncreate_mbuf_pool\n(\nvoid\n)\n{\n    \nint\n \nrc\n;\n\n    \nrc\n \n=\n \nos_mempool_init\n(\ng_mbuf_mempool\n, \nMBUF_NUM_MBUFS\n, \n                          \nMBUF_MEMBLOCK_SIZE\n, \ng_mbuf_buffer\n[\n0\n], \nmbuf_pool\n);\n    \nassert\n(\nrc\n \n==\n \n0\n);\n\n    \nrc\n \n=\n \nos_mbuf_pool_init\n(\ng_mbuf_pool\n, \ng_mbuf_mempool\n, \nMBUF_MEMBLOCK_SIZE\n, \n                           \nMBUF_NUM_MBUFS\n);\n    \nassert\n(\nrc\n \n==\n \n0\n);\n}\n\n\n\n\n\nUsing mbufs\n\n\nThe following examples illustrate typical mbuf usage. There are two basic mbuf allocation API: \nos_mbuf_get()\n and \nos_mbuf_get_pkthdr()\n. The first API obtains a normal mbuf whereas the latter obtains a packet header mbuf. Typically, application developers use \nos_mbuf_get_pkthdr()\n and rarely, if ever, need to call \nos_mbuf_get()\n as the rest of the mbuf API (e.g. \nos_mbuf_append()\n, \nos_mbuf_copyinto()\n, etc.) typically deal with allocating and chaining mbufs. It is recommended to use the provided API to copy data into/out of mbuf chains and/or manipulate mbufs.\n\n\nIn \nexample1\n, the developer creates a packet and then sends the packet to a networking interface. The code sample also provides an example of copying data out of an mbuf as well as use of the \"pullup\" api (another very common mbuf api).\n\n\nvoid\n\n\nmbuf_usage_example1\n(\nuint8_t\n \n*mydata\n, \nint\n \nmydata_length\n)\n{\n    \nint\n \nrc\n;\n    \nstruct\n \nos_mbuf\n \n*om\n;\n\n    \n/* get a packet header mbuf */\n\n    \nom\n \n=\n \nos_mbuf_get_pkthdr\n(\ng_mbuf_pool\n, \nsizeof\n(\nstruct\n \nuser_hdr\n));\n    \nif\n (\nom\n) {\n        \n/* \n\n\n         * Copy user data into mbuf. NOTE: if mydata_length is greater than the\n\n\n         * mbuf payload size (64 bytes using above example), mbufs are allocated\n\n\n         * and chained together to accommodate the total packet length.\n\n\n         */\n\n        \nrc\n \n=\n \nos_mbuf_copyinto\n(\nom\n, \n0\n, \nmydata\n, \nlen\n);\n        \nif\n (\nrc\n) {\n            \n/* Error! Could not allocate enough mbufs for total packet length */\n\n            \nreturn\n \n-\n1\n;\n        }\n\n        \n/* Send packet to networking interface */\n\n        \nsend_pkt\n(\nom\n);\n    }\n}\n\n\n\n\n\nIn \nexample2\n we show use of the pullup api as this illustrates some of the typical pitfalls developers encounter when using mbufs. The first pitfall is one of alignment/padding. Depending on the processor and/or compiler, the sizeof() a structure may vary. Thus, the size of \nmy_protocol_header\n may be different inside the packet data of the mbuf than the size of the structure on the stack or as a global variable, for instance. While some networking protcols may align protocol information on convenient processor boundaries many others try to conserve bytes \"on the air\" (i.e inside the packet data). Typical methods used to deal with this are \"packing\" the structure (i.e. force compiler to not pad) or creating protocol headers that do not require padding. \nexample2\n assumes that one of these methods was used when defining the \nmy_protocol_header\n structure.\n\n\nAnother common pitfall occurs around endianness. A network protocol may be little endian or big endian; it all depends on the protocol specification. Processors also have an endianness; this means that the developer has to be careful that the processor endianness and the protocol endianness are handled correctly. In \nexample2\n, some common networking functions are used: \nntohs()\n and \nntohl()\n. These are shorthand for \"network order to host order, short\" and \"network order to host order, long\". Basically, these functions convert data of a certain size (i.e. 16 bits, 32 bits, etc) to the endianness of the host. Network byte order is big-endian (most significant byte first), so these functions convert big-endian byte order to host order (thus, the implementation of these functions is host dependent). Note that the BLE networking stack \"on the air\" format is least signigicant byte first (i.e. little endian), so a \"bletoh\" function would have to take little endian format and convert to host format.\n\n\nA long story short: the developer must take care when copying structure data to/from mbufs and flat buffers!\n\n\nA final note: these examples assume the same mbuf struture and definitions used in the first example. \n\n\nvoid\n\n\nmbuf_usage_example2\n(\nstruct\n \nmbuf\n \n*rxpkt\n)\n{\n    \nint\n \nrc\n;\n    \nuint8_t\n \npacket_data\n[\n16\n];\n    \nstruct\n \nmbuf\n \n*om\n;\n    \nstruct\n \nmy_protocol_header\n \n*phdr\n;\n\n    \n/* Make sure that \nmy_protocol_header\n bytes are contiguous in mbuf */\n\n    \nom\n \n=\n \nos_mbuf_pullup\n(\ng_mbuf_pool\n, \nsizeof\n(\nstruct\n \nmy_protocol_header\n));\n    \nif\n (\n!om\n) {\n        \n/* Not able to pull up data into contiguous area */\n\n        \nreturn\n \n-\n1\n;\n    }\n\n    \n/* \n\n\n     * Get the protocol information from the packet.

The mbuf also generally stores header information or other networking stack information that is carried around with the packet. The mbuf and its associated library of functions were developed to make common networking stack operations (like stripping and adding protocol headers) efficient and as copy-free as possible.  In its simplest form, an mbuf is a memory block with some space reserved for internal information and a pointer which is used to \"chain\" memory blocks together in order to create a \"packet\". This is a very important aspect of the mbuf: the ability to chain mbufs together to create larger \"packets\" (chains of mbufs).",

The reason that this mbuf is special is that it contains the length of all the data contained by the chain of mbufs (the packet length, in other words). The packet header mbuf may also contain a user defined structure (called a \"user header\") so that networking protocol specific information can be conveyed to various layers of the networking stack. Any mbufs that are part of the packet (i.e. in the mbuf chain but not the first one) are \"normal\" (i.e. non-packet header) mbufs. A normal mbuf does not have any packet header or user packet header structures in them; they only contain the basic mbuf header ( struct os_mbuf ). Figure 1 illustrates these two types of mbufs. Note that the numbers/text in parentheses denote the size of the structures/elements (in bytes) and that MBLEN is the memory block length of the memory pool used by the mbuf pool.",

            "text": "Now let's take a deeper dive into the mbuf structure. Figure 2 illustrates a normal mbuf and breaks out the various fields in the  os_mbuf  structure.    The  om_data  field is a pointer to where the data starts inside the data buffer. Typically, mbufs that are allocated from the mbuf pool (discussed later) have their om_data pointer set to the start of the data buffer but there are cases where this may not be desirable (added a protocol header to a packet, for example).   The  om_flags  field is a set of flags used internally by the mbuf library. Currently, no flags have been defined.   The  om_pkthdr_len  field is the total length of all packet headers in the mbuf. For normal mbufs this is set to 0 as there is no packet or user packet headers. For packet header mbufs, this would be set to the length of the packet header structure (16) plus the size of the user packet header (if any). Note that it is this field which differentiates packet header mbufs from normal mbufs (i.e. if  om_pkthdr_len  is zero, this is a normal mbuf; otherwise it is a packet header mbuf).   The  om_len  field contains the amount of user data in the data buffer. When initially allocated, this field is 0 as there is no user data in the mbuf.   The  omp_pool  field is a pointer to the pool from which this mbuf has been allocated. This is used internally by the mbuf library.   The  omp_next  field is a linked list element which is used to chain mbufs.   Figure 2 also shows a normal mbuf with actual values in the  os_mbuf  structure. This mbuf starts at address 0x1000 and is 256 bytes in total length. In this example, the user has copied 33 bytes into the data buffer starting at address 0x1010 (this is where om_data points). Note that the packet header length in this mbuf is 0 as it is not a packet header mbuf.   Figure 3 illustrates the packet header mbuf along with some chained mbufs (i.e a \"packet\"). In this example, the user header structure is defined to be 8 bytes. Note that in figure 3 we show a number of different mbufs with varying  om_data  pointers and lengths since we want to show various examples of valid mbufs. For all the mbufs (both packet header and normal ones) the total length of the memory block is 128 bytes.",

The memory blocks in this memory pool are the actual mbufs; both normal and packet header mbufs. Thus, the memory block (and corresponding memory pool) must be sized correctly. In other words, the memory blocks which make up the memory pool used by the mbuf pool must be at least: sizeof(struct os_mbuf) + sizeof(struct os_mbuf_pkthdr) + sizeof(struct user_defined_header) + desired minimum data buffer length. For example, if the developer wants mbufs to contain at least 64 bytes of user data and they have a user header of 12 bytes, the size of the memory block would be (at least): 64 + 12 + 16 + 8, or 100 bytes.

Once the developer has determined the size of the user data needed per mbuf (this is based on the application/networking stack and is outside the scope of this discussion) and the size of the user header (if any), the memory blocks can be sized. In the example shown below, the application requires 64 bytes of user data per mbuf and also allocates a user header (called struct user_hdr). Note that we do not show the user header data structure as there really is no need; all we need to do is to account for it when creating the memory pool. In the example, we use the macro  MBUF_PKTHDR_OVERHEAD  to denote the amount of packet header overhead per mbuf and  MBUF_MEMBLOCK_OVERHEAD  to denote the total amount of overhead required per memory block. The macro  MBUF_BUF_SIZE  is used to denote the amount of payload that the application requires (aligned on a 32-bit boundary in this case).

            "text": "The following examples illustrate typical mbuf usage. There are two basic mbuf allocation API:  os_mbuf_get()  and  os_mbuf_get_pkthdr() . The first API obtains a normal mbuf whereas the latter obtains a packet header mbuf. Typically, application developers use  os_mbuf_get_pkthdr()  and rarely, if ever, need to call  os_mbuf_get()  as the rest of the mbuf API (e.g.  os_mbuf_append() ,  os_mbuf_copyinto() , etc.) typically deal with allocating and chaining mbufs. It is recommended to use the provided API to copy data into/out of mbuf chains and/or manipulate mbufs.  In  example1 , the developer creates a packet and then sends the packet to a networking interface. The code sample also provides an example of copying data out of an mbuf as well as use of the \"pullup\" api (another very common mbuf api).  void  mbuf_usage_example1 ( uint8_t   *mydata ,  int   mydata_length )\n{\n     int   rc ;\n     struct   os_mbuf   *om ;\n\n     /* get a packet header mbuf */ \n     om   =   os_mbuf_get_pkthdr ( g_mbuf_pool ,  sizeof ( struct   user_hdr ));\n     if  ( om ) {\n         /*            * Copy user data into mbuf.

Could not allocate enough mbufs for total packet length */ \n             return   - 1 ;\n        }\n\n         /* Send packet to networking interface */ \n         send_pkt ( om );\n    }\n}  In  example2  we show use of the pullup api as this illustrates some of the typical pitfalls developers encounter when using mbufs. The first pitfall is one of alignment/padding. Depending on the processor and/or compiler, the sizeof() a structure may vary. Thus, the size of  my_protocol_header  may be different inside the packet data of the mbuf than the size of the structure on the stack or as a global variable, for instance. While some networking protcols may align protocol information on convenient processor boundaries many others try to conserve bytes \"on the air\" (i.e inside the packet data). Typical methods used to deal with this are \"packing\" the structure (i.e. force compiler to not pad) or creating protocol headers that do not require padding.  example2  assumes that one of these methods was used when defining the  my_protocol_header  structure.  Another common pitfall occurs around endianness. A network protocol may be little endian or big endian; it all depends on the protocol specification. Processors also have an endianness; this means that the developer has to be careful that the processor endianness and the protocol endianness are handled correctly. In  example2 , some common networking functions are used:  ntohs()  and  ntohl() . These are shorthand for \"network order to host order, short\" and \"network order to host order, long\". Basically, these functions convert data of a certain size (i.e. 16 bits, 32 bits, etc) to the endianness of the host. Network byte order is big-endian (most significant byte first), so these functions convert big-endian byte order to host order (thus, the implementation of these functions is host dependent). Note that the BLE networking stack \"on the air\" format is least signigicant byte first (i.e. little endian), so a \"bletoh\" function would have to take little endian format and convert to host format.  A long story short: the developer must take care when copying structure data to/from mbufs and flat buffers!

The developer can create different size mbuf pools and register them with msys. The application then allocates mbufs using the msys API (as opposed to the mbuf API). The msys code will choose the mbuf pool with the smallest mbufs that can accommodate the requested size. \n\n\nLet us walk through an example where the user registers three mbuf pools with msys: one with 32 byte mbufs, one with 256 and one with 2048. If the user requests an mbuf with 10 bytes, the 32-byte mbuf pool is used. If the request is for 33 bytes the 256 byte mbuf pool is used. If an mbuf data size is requested that is larger than any of the pools (say, 4000 bytes) the largest pool is used. While this behaviour may not be optimal in all cases that is the currently implemented behaviour. All this means is that the user is not guaranteed that a single mbuf can hold the requested data.\n\n\nThe msys code will not allocate an mbuf from a larger pool if the chosen mbuf pool is empty. Similarly, the msys code will not chain together a number of smaller mbufs to accommodate the requested size. While this behaviour may change in future implementations the current code will simply return NULL. Using the above example, say the user requests 250 bytes. The msys code chooses the appropriate pool (i.e. the 256 byte mbuf pool) and attempts to allocate an mbuf from that pool. If that pool is empty, NULL is returned even though the 32 and 2048 byte pools are not empty.\n\n\nNote that no added descriptions on how to use the msys API are presented here (other than in the API descriptions themselves) as the msys API is used in exactly the same manner as the mbuf API.

            "text": "Msys stands for \"system mbufs\" and is a set of API built on top of the mbuf code. The basic idea behind msys is the following. The developer can create different size mbuf pools and register them with msys. The application then allocates mbufs using the msys API (as opposed to the mbuf API). The msys code will choose the mbuf pool with the smallest mbufs that can accommodate the requested size.   Let us walk through an example where the user registers three mbuf pools with msys: one with 32 byte mbufs, one with 256 and one with 2048. If the user requests an mbuf with 10 bytes, the 32-byte mbuf pool is used. If the request is for 33 bytes the 256 byte mbuf pool is used. If an mbuf data size is requested that is larger than any of the pools (say, 4000 bytes) the largest pool is used. While this behaviour may not be optimal in all cases that is the currently implemented behaviour. All this means is that the user is not guaranteed that a single mbuf can hold the requested data.  The msys code will not allocate an mbuf from a larger pool if the chosen mbuf pool is empty.

First is \nstruct os_callout\n, which is a bare-bones version. You would initialize this with \nos_callout_init()\n.\n\n\nSecond option is \nstruct os_callout_func\n. This you can use if you expect to have multiple different types of timers in your task, running concurrently. The structure contains a function pointer, and you would call that function from your task's event processing loop.\n\n\nTime unit when arming the timer is OS ticks. This rate of this ticker depends on the platform this is running on. You should use OS define \nOS_TICKS_PER_SEC\n to convert wallclock time to OS  ticks.\n\n\nCallout timer fires out just once.

            "text": "Callout is a way of setting up an OS timer. When the timer fires, it is delivered as an event to task's event queue.  User would initialize their callout structure using  os_callout_init() , or  os_callout_func_init()  and then arm it with  os_callout_reset() .  If user wants to cancel the timer before it expires, they can either use  os_callout_reset()  to arm it for later expiry, or stop it altogether by calling  os_callout_stop() .  There are 2 different options for data structure to use. First is  struct os_callout , which is a bare-bones version. You would initialize this with  os_callout_init() .  Second option is  struct os_callout_func . This you can use if you expect to have multiple different types of timers in your task, running concurrently. The structure contains a function pointer, and you would call that function from your task's event processing loop.  Time unit when arming the timer is OS ticks. This rate of this ticker depends on the platform this is running on. You should use OS define  OS_TICKS_PER_SEC  to convert wallclock time to OS  ticks.  Callout timer fires out just once. For periodic timer type of operation you need to rearm it once it fires.",

For a description of the HAL abstraction and implementation information,\nsee the \nHAL API\n\n\nCPU Core Dependency\n\n\nSome OS code depends on the CPU core that your system is using.

Some architectures (like ARM) have special libraries to make BSP creation easier.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCreate or Copy Linker Script\n\n\nIt's probably best to start with a linker script from another BSP using the same MCU.  If this is not available, consult your MCU documentation and library samples to find a linker script to start with.\n\n\nTypically, a linker script has to specify the following sections for code:\n\n\n\n\n.text -- the location and alignment of the memory section to store your code\n\n\n.data -- the location and alignment of the memory section to store initialized data\n\n\n.bss -- the location and alignment of the memory section to store uninitialized data\n\n\n.heap -- the location and alignment of the memory section to provide system memory\n\n\n\n\nThe linker script should specify the location and size of the different memory regions in your BSP and map the code sections described above into these regions.  \n\n\nThe linker script should also include an ENTRY point. This is used by the debugger to know where to start the program counter when the target is debugged.\n\n\nThere may be additional requirements from the MCU or OS that you may find easiest to place in the linker script. Some specific variables that the OS and MCU depends on are :\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVariable\n\n\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n__bss_start__\n\n\na variable located at the start of the BSS section\n\n\n\n\n\n\n__bss_end__\n\n\na variable located at the end of the BSS section\n\n\n\n\n\n\n__isr_vector\n\n\nSome CPUs map their interrupt vectors. They may need to be specified in the linker\n\n\n\n\n\n\n_user_heap_start\n\n\nthe start of the heap for unallocated memory\n\n\n\n\n\n\n_user_heap_end\n\n\nthe end of the heap for unallocated memory\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCreate an alternate linker script for the bootloader since it is typically linked to use different addresses to boot the main image.  \n\n\nAdd Functions and Defines\n\n\nAt this point, it will be possible to run the \nnewt\n tool to build your target. \n\n\nYou may run into complaints from the linker script that a few Mynewt specific functions are missing.  We will describe these below.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFunction\n\n\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nos_bsp_init()\n\n\ncode to initialize the bsp\n\n\n\n\n\n\nos_bsp_systick_init()\n\n\ncode to setup the system tick for the OS\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere are also several libc definitions that can be stubbed in your first BSP. Examples are \n_write\n, \n_read\n, etc. that can be found in \nlibc_stubs.c\n. But you \nmust\n implement the following function to provide memory to the OS and system.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFunction\n\n\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n_sbrk\n\n\nReturns memory from heap (used by malloc)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImplement \n_sbrk()\n\n\n\n\nsbrk()\n is required by libc to get memory from the heap for things like malloc. Although not strongly BSP dependent, this is currently in the BSP to allow  flexibility in providing system memory.  See other BSPs for providing \nsbrk\n functionality.\n\n\n\n\nImplement \nos_bsp_init()\n\n\n\n\nos_bsp_init\n should initialize anything required by the OS by the BSP. Typically this is a very small set.  \n\n\nNOTE: Currently we are making calls to \n_sbrk()\n and \nclose(0)\n from \nos_bsp_init\n to get around a linker issue where some of libc is not getting included.  Please include this in your \nos_bsp_init\n.\n\n\n    \n/*\n\n\n     * XXX these references are here to keep the functions in for libc to find.\n\n\n     */\n\n    \n_sbrk\n(\n0\n);\n    \n_close\n(\n0\n);\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOther Unresolved Defines or Functions\n\n\n\n\nThere may be other unresolved defines or functions that are required by the specific MCU within your BSP. Below lists some sample defines.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUndefined Variable\n\n\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCONSOLE_UART_PORT\n\n\nWhich communications port on your target runs the console\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLED_BLINK_PIN\n\n\nwhich pin on your target runs the blinky LED\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe set of missing functionality depends upon the libraries and dependencies you have included in the project.  That's why its best to keep your first project pretty simple then add incrementally.  For example, if you include Newtron file system, you will need to define a file system map for your BSP.\n\n\nMissing functionality may take the form of \n#define\n items required to compile, or they may take the form of missing functions.  \n\n\n\n\ncmsis_nvic.h\n\n\n\n\nIf you are using an ARM cortex architecture, you need to define the number of interrupts supported by your system.  If you are not using ARM Cortex architecture this may not be required (but something else might be).\n\n\nAdd Debug Script\n\n\nThe debug script in the bsp directory allows the newt tool to automatically connect to the debugger, and create a debug session with the target.  This requires knowledge of your target debug interface. Most of the Mynewt BSP targets use \nopenocd\n to perform debugging.  This script typically creates an openocd connection to the target and then connects a gdb instance to this openocd connection.  There are several examples in existing BSPs to follow.\n\n\nThe script must take a single argument which is the name of the image file minus the '.elf' suffix.\n\n\nThe BSP is complete without this file, but newt will be unable to establish a debug session without it.\n\n\nAdd Download Script\n\n\nSimilar to the debug script, the download script is a hook for newt to download the image to the target system.  The download script also typically uses openocd interface to erase flash, and progam the code into the device.\n\n\nNOTE: The download script needs to command openocd to program the image into the appropriate location, which is typically called \nFLASH_OFFSET\n in  these scripts. This location has to match the linker script location of the image link address.  For example, if your linker links the code to be run at \n0xC000\n your download script should download the image to the same\naddress in the correct flash.  \n\n\nAdd License and Documentation\n\n\nThe \nLICENSE\n file is an ASCII text file that describes the source license for this\npackage.\n\n\nThe \nREADME.md\n is a \nmarkdown\n\n file that contains any documentation you \nwant to provide for the BSP.",

You may run into complaints from the linker script that a few Mynewt specific functions are missing.  We will describe these below.     Function  Description      os_bsp_init()  code to initialize the bsp    os_bsp_systick_init()  code to setup the system tick for the OS     There are also several libc definitions that can be stubbed in your first BSP. Examples are  _write ,  _read , etc. that can be found in  libc_stubs.c . But you  must  implement the following function to provide memory to the OS and system.     Function  Description      _sbrk  Returns memory from heap (used by malloc)      Implement  _sbrk()   sbrk()  is required by libc to get memory from the heap for things like malloc. Although not strongly BSP dependent, this is currently in the BSP to allow  flexibility in providing system memory.  See other BSPs for providing  sbrk  functionality.   Implement  os_bsp_init()   os_bsp_init  should initialize anything required by the OS by the BSP. Typically this is a very small set.    NOTE: Currently we are making calls to  _sbrk()  and  close(0)  from  os_bsp_init  to get around a linker issue where some of libc is not getting included.  Please include this in your  os_bsp_init .       /*       * XXX these references are here to keep the functions in for libc to find.       */ \n     _sbrk ( 0 );\n     _close ( 0 );   Other Unresolved Defines or Functions   There may be other unresolved defines or functions that are required by the specific MCU within your BSP. Below lists some sample defines.     Undefined Variable  Description      CONSOLE_UART_PORT  Which communications port on your target runs the console    LED_BLINK_PIN  which pin on your target runs the blinky LED     The set of missing functionality depends upon the libraries and dependencies you have included in the project.  That's why its best to keep your first project pretty simple then add incrementally.  For example, if you include Newtron file system, you will need to define a file system map for your BSP.  Missing functionality may take the form of  #define  items required to compile, or they may take the form of missing functions.     cmsis_nvic.h   If you are using an ARM cortex architecture, you need to define the number of interrupts supported by your system.  If you are not using ARM Cortex architecture this may not be required (but something else might be).",

Shell runs on its own task.\n\n\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShell's first job is directing incoming commands to other subsystems. It parses the incoming character string, and splits it into tokens. Then it looks for the subsystem to handle this command based on the first token of input.\n\n\nSubsystems register their command handlers using \nshell_cmd_register()\n. When shell calls the command handler, it passes the other tokens as arguments.\n\n\nA few commands are currently available in the shell - \ntasks\n, \nlog\n, and \nstat stat\n. A $ prompt sign will be coming soon!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShell's second job is doing framing, encoding and decoding newtmgr protocol when it's carried over the console. Protocol handler (libs/newtmgr) registers itself using \nshell_nlip_input_register()\n, and shell calls the registered handler for every frame.

Then it looks for the subsystem to handle this command based on the first token of input.  Subsystems register their command handlers using  shell_cmd_register() . When shell calls the command handler, it passes the other tokens as arguments.  A few commands are currently available in the shell -  tasks ,  log , and  stat stat . A $ prompt sign will be coming soon!    Shell's second job is doing framing, encoding and decoding newtmgr protocol when it's carried over the console. Protocol handler (libs/newtmgr) registers itself using  shell_nlip_input_register() , and shell calls the registered handler for every frame.

Together, the set of blocks in a file form a reverse singly-linked list.\n\n\nThe maximum number of data bytes that a block can contain is determined at initialization-time.  The result is the greatest number which satisfies all of the following restrictions:\n\n\n\n\nNo more than 2048.\n\n\nAt least two maximum-sized blocks can fit in the smallest area.\n\n\n\n\nThe 2048 number was chosen somewhat arbitrarily, and may change in the future.\n\n\nID space\n\n\nAll disk objects have a unique 32-bit ID.

The scratch area must have a size greater than or equal to each of the other areas in flash.\n\n\nRAM representation\n\n\nEvery object in the file system is stored in a 256-entry hash table.  An object's hash key is derived from its 32-bit ID.  Each list in the hash table is sorted by time of use; most-recently-used is at the front of the list. All objects are represented by the following structure:\n\n\n/**\n\n\n * What gets stored in the hash table.  Each entry represents a data block or\n\n\n * an inode.\n\n\n */\n\n\nstruct\n \nnffs_hash_entry\n {\n    \nSLIST_ENTRY\n(\nnffs_hash_entry\n) \nnhe_next\n;\n    \nuint32_t\n \nnhe_id\n;        \n/* 0 - 0x7fffffff if inode; else if block. */\n\n    \nuint32_t\n \nnhe_flash_loc\n; \n/* Upper-byte = area idx; rest = area offset. */\n\n};\n\n\n\n\n\nFor each data block, the above structure is all that is stored in RAM.  To acquire more information about a data block, the block header must be read from flash.\n\n\nInodes require a fuller RAM representation to capture the structure of the file system.  There are two types of inodes: \nfiles\n and \ndirectories\n.  Each inode hash entry is actually an instance of the following structure:\n\n\n/** Each inode hash entry is actually one of these. */\n\n\nstruct\n \nnffs_inode_entry\n {\n    \nstruct\n \nnffs_hash_entry\n \nnie_hash_entry\n;\n    \nSLIST_ENTRY\n(\nnffs_inode_entry\n) \nnie_sibling_next\n;\n    \nunion\n {\n        \nstruct\n \nnffs_inode_list\n \nnie_child_list\n;           \n/* If directory */\n\n        \nstruct\n \nnffs_hash_entry\n \n*nie_last_block_entry\n;    \n/* If file */\n\n    };\n    \nuint8_t\n \nnie_refcnt\n;\n};\n\n\n\n\n\nA directory inode contains a list of its child files and directories (\nfie_child_list\n).  These entries are sorted alphabetically using the ASCII character set.\n\n\nA file inode contains a pointer to the last data block in the file (\nnie_last_block_entry\n).  For most file operations, the reversed block list must be walked backwards.  This introduces a number of speed inefficiencies:\n\n\n\n\nAll data blocks must be read to determine the length of the file.\n\n\nData blocks often need to be processed sequentially.  The reversed nature of the block list transforms this from linear time to an O(n^2) operation.\n\n\n\n\nFurthermore, obtaining information about any constituent data block requires a separate flash read.\n\n\nInode cache and Data Block cache\n\n\nThe speed issues are addressed by a pair of caches.  Cached inodes entries contain the file length and a much more convenient doubly-linked list of cached data blocks.  The benefit of using caches is that the size of the caches need not be proportional to the size of the file system.  In other words, caches can address speed efficiency concerns without negatively impacting the file system's scalability.\n\n\nnffs requires both caches during normal operation, so it is not possible to disable them.  However, the cache sizes are configurable, and both caches can be configured with a size of one if RAM usage must be minimized.\n\n\nThe following data structures are used in the inode and data block caches.\n\n\n/** Full data block representation; not stored permanently in RAM. */\n\n\nstruct\n \nnffs_block\n {\n    \nstruct\n \nnffs_hash_entry\n \n*nb_hash_entry\n;   \n/* Points to real block entry. */\n\n    \nuint32_t\n \nnb_seq\n;                         \n/* Sequence number; greater\n\n\n                                                supersedes lesser. */\n\n    \nstruct\n \nnffs_inode_entry\n \n*nb_inode_entry\n; \n/* Owning inode. */\n\n    \nstruct\n \nnffs_hash_entry\n \n*nb_prev\n;         \n/* Previous block in file. */\n\n    \nuint16_t\n \nnb_data_len\n;                    \n/* # of data bytes in block. */\n\n    \nuint16_t\n \nreserved16\n;\n};\n\n\n\n\n\n/** Represents a single cached data block. */\n\n\nstruct\n \nnffs_cache_block\n {\n    \nTAILQ_ENTRY\n(\nnffs_cache_block\n) \nncb_link\n; \n/* Next / prev cached block. */\n\n    \nstruct\n \nnffs_block\n \nncb_block\n;            \n/* Full data block. */\n\n    \nuint32_t\n \nncb_file_offset\n;               \n/* File offset of this block. */\n\n};\n\n\n\n\n\n/** Full inode representation; not stored permanently in RAM. */\n\n\nstruct\n \nnffs_inode\n {\n    \nstruct\n \nnffs_inode_entry\n \n*ni_inode_entry\n; \n/* Points to real inode entry. */\n\n    \nuint32_t\n \nni_seq\n;                         \n/* Sequence number; greater\n\n\n                                                supersedes lesser. */\n\n    \nstruct\n \nnffs_inode_entry\n \n*ni_parent\n;      \n/* Points to parent directory. */\n\n    \nuint8_t\n \nni_filename_len\n;                 \n/* # chars in filename. */\n\n    \nuint8_t\n \nni_filename\n[\nNFFS_SHORT_FILENAME_LEN\n]; \n/* First 3 bytes. */\n\n};\n\n\n\n\n\n/** Doubly-linked tail queue of cached blocks; contained in cached inodes. */\n\n\nTAILQ_HEAD\n(\nnffs_block_cache_list\n, \nnffs_block_cache_entry\n);\n\n\n/** Represents a single cached file inode. */\n\n\nstruct\n \nnffs_cache_inode\n {\n    \nTAILQ_ENTRY\n(\nnffs_cache_inode\n) \nnci_link\n;        \n/* Sorted; LRU at tail. */\n\n    \nstruct\n \nnffs_inode\n \nnci_inode\n;                   \n/* Full inode. */\n\n    \nstruct\n \nnffs_cache_block_list\n \nnci_block_list\n;   \n/* List of cached blocks. */\n\n    \nuint32_t\n \nnci_file_size\n;                        \n/* Total file size. */\n\n};\n\n\n\n\n\nOnly file inodes are cached; directory inodes are never cached.\n\n\nWithin a cached inode, all cached data blocks are contiguous.  E.g., if the start and end of a file are cached, then the middle must also be cached.  A data block is only cached if its owning file is also cached.\n\n\nInternally, cached inodes are stored in a singly-linked list, ordered by time of use.  The most-recently-used entry is the first element in the list.  If a new inode needs to be cached, but the inode cache is full, the least-recently-used entry is freed to make room for the new one.  The following operations cause an inode to be cached:\n\n\n\n\nQuerying a file's length.\n\n\nSeeking within a file.\n\n\nReading from a file.\n\n\nWriting to a file.\n\n\n\n\nThe following operations cause a data block to be cached:\n\n\n\n\nReading from the block.\n\n\nWriting to the block.\n\n\n\n\nIf one of the above operations is applied to a data block that is not currently cached, nffs uses the following procedure to cache the necessary block:\n\n\n\n\nIf none of the owning inode's blocks are currently cached, allocate a cached block entry corresponding to the requested block and insert it into the inode's list.\n\n\nElse if the requested file offset is less than that of the first cached block, bridge the gap between the inode's sequence of cached blocks and the block that now needs to be cached.  This is accomplished by caching each block in the gap, finishing with the requested block.\n\n\nElse (the requested offset is beyond the end of the cache),\n\n\nIf the requested offset belongs to the block that immediately follows the end of the cache, cache the block and append it to the list.\n\n\nElse, clear the cache, and populate it with the single entry corresponding to the requested block.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf the system is unable to allocate a cached block entry at any point during the above procedure, the system frees up other blocks currently in the cache. This is accomplished as follows:\n\n\n\n\nIterate the inode cache in reverse (i.e., start with the least-recently-used entry).  For each entry:\n\n\nIf the entry's cached block list is empty, advance to the next entry.\n\n\nElse, free all the cached blocks in the entry's list.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBecause the system imposes a minimum block cache size of one, the above procedure will always reclaim at least one cache block entry.  The above procedure may result in the freeing of the block list that belongs to the very inode being operated on.  This is OK, as the final block to get cached is always the block being requested.\n\n\nDetection\n\n\nThe file system detection process consists of scanning a specified set of flash regions for valid nffs areas, and then populating the RAM representation of the file system with the detected objects.  Detection is initiated with the \nnffs_detect()\n function.\n\n\nNot every area descriptor passed to \nnffs_detect()\n needs to reference a valid nffs area.  Detection is successful as long as a complete file system is detected somewhere in the specified regions of flash.  If an application is unsure where a file system might be located, it can initiate detection across the entire flash region.\n\n\nA detected file system is valid if:\n\n\n\n\nAt least one non-scratch area is present.\n\n\nAt least one scratch area is present (only the first gets used if there is more than one).\n\n\nThe root directory inode is present.\n\n\n\n\nDuring detection, each indicated region of flash is checked for a valid area header.  The contents of each valid non-scratch area are then restored into the nffs RAM representation.  The following procedure is applied to each object in the area:\n\n\n\n\nVerify the object's integrity via a crc16 check.  If invalid, the object is discarded and the procedure restarts on the next object in the area.\n\n\nConvert the disk object into its corresponding RAM representation and insert it into the hash table.  If the object is an inode, its reference count is initialized to 1, indicating ownership by its parent directory.\n\n\nIf an object with the same ID is already present, then one supersedes the other.  Accept the object with the greater sequence number and discard the other.\n\n\nIf the object references a nonexistent inode (parent directory in the case of an inode; owning file in the case of a data block), insert a temporary \"dummy\" inode into the hash table so that inter-object links can be maintained until the absent inode is eventually restored.  Dummy inodes are identified by a reference count of 0.\n\n\nIf a delete record for an inode is encountered, the inode's parent pointer is set to null to indicate that it should be removed from RAM.\n\n\n\n\nIf nffs encounters an object that cannot be identified (i.e., its magic number is not valid), it scans the remainder of the flash area for the next valid magic number.  Upon encountering a valid object, nffs resumes the procedure described above.\n\n\nAfter all areas have been restored, a sweep is performed across the entire RAM representation so that invalid inodes can be deleted from memory.\n\n\nFor each directory inode:\n\n\n\n\nIf its reference count is 0 (i.e., it is a dummy), migrate its children to the \n/lost+found\n directory, and delete it from the RAM representation. This should only happen in the case of file system corruption.\n\n\nIf its parent reference is null (i.e., it was deleted), delete it and all its children from the RAM representation.\n\n\n\n\nFor each file inode:\n\n\n\n\nIf its reference count is 0 (i.e., it is a dummy), delete it from the RAM representation.  This should only happen in the case of file system corruption.  (We should try to migrate the file to the lost+found directory in this case, as mentioned in the todo section).\n\n\n\n\nWhen an object is deleted during this sweep, it is only deleted from the RAM representation; nothing is written to disk.\n\n\nWhen objects are migrated to the lost+found directory, their parent inode reference is permanently updated on the disk.\n\n\nIn addition, a single scratch area is identified during the detection process.  The first area whose \nfda_id\n value is set to 0xff is designated as the file system scratch area.  If no valid scratch area is found, the cause could be that the system was restarted while a garbage collection cycle was in progress.  Such a condition is identified by the presence of two areas with the same ID.  In such a case, the shorter of the two areas is erased and designated as the scratch area.\n\n\nFormatting\n\n\nA new nffs file system is created via formatting.  Formatting is achieved via the \nnffs_format()\n function.\n\n\nDuring a successful format, an area header is written to each of the specified locations.  One of the areas in the set is designated as the initial scratch area.\n\n\nFlash writes\n\n\nThe nffs implementation always writes in a strictly sequential fashion within an area.  For each area, the system keeps track of the current offset.  Whenever an object gets written to an area, it gets written to that area's current offset, and the offset is increased by the object's disk size.\n\n\nWhen a write needs to be performed, the nffs implementation selects the appropriate destination area by iterating though each area until one with sufficient free space is encountered.\n\n\nThere is no write buffering.  Each call to a write function results in a write operation being sent to the flash hardware.\n\n\nNew objects\n\n\nWhenever a new object is written to disk, it is assigned the following properties:\n\n\n\n\nID:\n A unique value is selected from the 32-bit ID space, as appropriate for the object's type.\n\n\nSequence number:\n 0\n\n\n\n\nWhen a new file or directory is created, a corresponding inode is written to flash.  Likewise, a new data block also results in the writing of a corresponding disk object.\n\n\nMoving/Renaming files and directories\n\n\nWhen a file or directory is moved or renamed, its corresponding inode is rewritten to flash with the following properties:\n\n\n\n\nID:\n Unchanged\n\n\nSequence number:\n Previous value plus one.\n\n\nParent inode:\n As specified by the move / rename operation.\n\n\nFilename:\n As specified by the move / rename operation.\n\n\n\n\nBecause the inode's ID is unchanged, all dependent objects remain valid.\n\n\nUnlinking files and directories\n\n\nWhen a file or directory is unlinked from its parent directory, a deletion record for the unlinked inode gets written to flash.  The deletion record is an inode with the following properties:\n\n\n\n\nID:\n Unchanged\n\n\nSequence number:\n Previous value plus one.\n\n\nParent inode ID:\n NFFS_ID_NONE\n\n\n\n\nWhen an inode is unlinked, no deletion records need to be written for the inode's dependent objects (constituent data blocks or child inodes).  During the next file system detection, it is recognized that the objects belong to a deleted inode, so they are not restored into the RAM representation.\n\n\nIf a file has an open handle at the time it gets unlinked, application code can continued to use the file handle to read and write data.  All files retain a reference count, and a file isn't deleted from the RAM representation until its reference code drops to 0.  Any attempt to open an unlinked file fails, even if the file is referenced by other file handles.\n\n\nWriting to a file\n\n\nThe following procedure is used whenever the application code writes to a file.  First, if the write operation specifies too much data to fit into a single block, the operation is split into several separate write operations.  Then, for each write operation:\n\n\n\n\nDetermine which existing blocks the write operation overlaps (n = number of overwritten blocks).\n\n\nIf \nn = 0\n, this is an append operation.  Write a data block with the following properties:\n\n\nID:\n New unique value.\n\n\nSequence number:\n 0.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nElse \n(n \n 1)\n, this write overlaps existing data.\n\n\nFor each block in \n[1, 2, ... n-1]\n, write a new block containing the updated contents.  Each new block supersedes the block it overwrites.  That is, each block has the following properties:\n\n\nID:\n Unchanged\n\n\nSequence number:\n Previous value plus one.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWrite the nth block.  The nth block includes all appended data, if any.  As with the other blocks, its ID is unchanged and its sequence number is incremented.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAppended data can only be written to the end of the file.  That is, \"holes\" are not supported.\n\n\nGarbage collection\n\n\nWhen the file system is too full to accommodate a write operation, the system must perform garbage collection to make room.  The garbage collection procedure is described below:\n\n\n\n\nThe non-scratch area with the lowest garbage collection sequence number is selected as the \"source area.\"  If there are other areas with the same sequence number, the one with the smallest flash offset is selected. \n\n\nThe source area's ID is written to the scratch area's header, transforming it into a non-scratch ID.  This former scratch area is now known as the \"destination area.\"\n\n\nThe RAM representation is exhaustively searched for collectible objects.  The following procedure is applied to each inode in the system:\n\n\nIf the inode is resident in the source area, copy the inode record to the destination area.\n\n\nIf the inode is a file inode, walk the inode's list of data blocks, starting with the last block in the file.  Each block that is resident in the source area is copied to the destination area.  If there is a run of two or more blocks that are resident in the source area, they are consolidated and copied to the destination area as a single new block (subject to the maximum block size restriction).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe source area is reformatted as a scratch sector (i.e., is is fully erased, and its header is rewritten with an ID of 0xff).  The area's garbage collection sequence number is incremented prior to rewriting the header.  This area is now the new scratch sector.",

The most-recently-used entry is the first element in the list.  If a new inode needs to be cached, but the inode cache is full, the least-recently-used entry is freed to make room for the new one.  The following operations cause an inode to be cached:   Querying a file's length.  Seeking within a file.  Reading from a file.  Writing to a file.   The following operations cause a data block to be cached:   Reading from the block.  Writing to the block.   If one of the above operations is applied to a data block that is not currently cached, nffs uses the following procedure to cache the necessary block:   If none of the owning inode's blocks are currently cached, allocate a cached block entry corresponding to the requested block and insert it into the inode's list.  Else if the requested file offset is less than that of the first cached block, bridge the gap between the inode's sequence of cached blocks and the block that now needs to be cached.  This is accomplished by caching each block in the gap, finishing with the requested block.  Else (the requested offset is beyond the end of the cache),  If the requested offset belongs to the block that immediately follows the end of the cache, cache the block and append it to the list.  Else, clear the cache, and populate it with the single entry corresponding to the requested block.     If the system is unable to allocate a cached block entry at any point during the above procedure, the system frees up other blocks currently in the cache. This is accomplished as follows:   Iterate the inode cache in reverse (i.e., start with the least-recently-used entry).  For each entry:  If the entry's cached block list is empty, advance to the next entry.  Else, free all the cached blocks in the entry's list.     Because the system imposes a minimum block cache size of one, the above procedure will always reclaim at least one cache block entry.  The above procedure may result in the freeing of the block list that belongs to the very inode being operated on.  This is OK, as the final block to get cached is always the block being requested.",

            "text": "The file system detection process consists of scanning a specified set of flash regions for valid nffs areas, and then populating the RAM representation of the file system with the detected objects.  Detection is initiated with the  nffs_detect()  function.  Not every area descriptor passed to  nffs_detect()  needs to reference a valid nffs area.  Detection is successful as long as a complete file system is detected somewhere in the specified regions of flash.  If an application is unsure where a file system might be located, it can initiate detection across the entire flash region.  A detected file system is valid if:   At least one non-scratch area is present.  At least one scratch area is present (only the first gets used if there is more than one).  The root directory inode is present.   During detection, each indicated region of flash is checked for a valid area header.  The contents of each valid non-scratch area are then restored into the nffs RAM representation.  The following procedure is applied to each object in the area:   Verify the object's integrity via a crc16 check.  If invalid, the object is discarded and the procedure restarts on the next object in the area.  Convert the disk object into its corresponding RAM representation and insert it into the hash table.  If the object is an inode, its reference count is initialized to 1, indicating ownership by its parent directory.  If an object with the same ID is already present, then one supersedes the other.  Accept the object with the greater sequence number and discard the other.  If the object references a nonexistent inode (parent directory in the case of an inode; owning file in the case of a data block), insert a temporary \"dummy\" inode into the hash table so that inter-object links can be maintained until the absent inode is eventually restored.  Dummy inodes are identified by a reference count of 0.  If a delete record for an inode is encountered, the inode's parent pointer is set to null to indicate that it should be removed from RAM.   If nffs encounters an object that cannot be identified (i.e., its magic number is not valid), it scans the remainder of the flash area for the next valid magic number.  Upon encountering a valid object, nffs resumes the procedure described above.  After all areas have been restored, a sweep is performed across the entire RAM representation so that invalid inodes can be deleted from memory.  For each directory inode:   If its reference count is 0 (i.e., it is a dummy), migrate its children to the  /lost+found  directory, and delete it from the RAM representation. This should only happen in the case of file system corruption.  If its parent reference is null (i.e., it was deleted), delete it and all its children from the RAM representation.   For each file inode:   If its reference count is 0 (i.e., it is a dummy), delete it from the RAM representation.  This should only happen in the case of file system corruption.  (We should try to migrate the file to the lost+found directory in this case, as mentioned in the todo section).   When an object is deleted during this sweep, it is only deleted from the RAM representation; nothing is written to disk.  When objects are migrated to the lost+found directory, their parent inode reference is permanently updated on the disk.  In addition, a single scratch area is identified during the detection process.  The first area whose  fda_id  value is set to 0xff is designated as the file system scratch area.  If no valid scratch area is found, the cause could be that the system was restarted while a garbage collection cycle was in progress.  Such a condition is identified by the presence of two areas with the same ID.  In such a case, the shorter of the two areas is erased and designated as the scratch area.",

The bus acquisition portion is important because\nthe bus is typically multi-master so other devices may be trying to read/write\nthe same peripheral.  \n\n\nHAL_I2C implements a master interface to the I\u00b2C bus.  Typical usage of the \ninterface would involve the following steps.\n\n\n\n\ninitialize an I\u00b2C device using \nhal_i2c_init\n\n\nwhen you want to perform an I\u00b2C transaction:\n\n\nIssue the \nhal_i2c_begin()\n command.    \n\n\nIssue one or more  \nhal_i2c_read\n and/or \nhal_i2c_write\n commands\n\n\nIssue the \nhal_i2c_end()\n command.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAn addition API was added called \nhal_i2c_probe\n.  This command combines\n\nhal_i2c_begin()\n, \nhal_i2c_read\n, and \nhal_i2c_end()\n to try to read 0-bytes\nfrom a specific bus address.  its intended to provide an easy way to probe\nthe bus for a specific device.

The module declares that the GPIO to \ncontrol the light switch is declared elsewhere in one of two methods.     extern const int light_switch_gpio;  or      extern int bsp_light_app_get_light_gpio();  Which method a library uses \n(extern const versus function) depends on what functionality the library\nmight wish to declare.  The  extern const  model uses the smallest code \nfootprint, but since its constant cannot be changed at runtime (based on \nthe configuration of the device say).  The  extern function  call requires\nthe BSP to implement a function which allows flexibility to assign the \nGPIO for the light switch to be determined at runtime with a small expense of\nslightly more code.  Then the  libs/light  would go on to use the specified GPIO during its runtime\nexecution. For example this shows both ways the library could interface to the \nbsp to get the right GPIO:      void light_on(void) {\n        . . .\n        /* finally time to turn the light on */\n        hal_gpio_set(light_switch_gpio);\n    }\n\n    void light_on(void) {\n        . . .\n        int pin = bsp_light_app_get_light_gpio();\n        /* finally time to turn the light on */\n        hal_gpio_set(pin);\n    }  When you library user includes  libs/light  as a dependency and then builds\nwith  newt , they will get an unresolved external for either  light_switch_gpio  \nor  bsp_light_app_get_light_gpio()  and will need to add to their BSP.  In their BSP, they can add      const int light_switch_gpio = 5;  or     int bsp_light_app_get_light_gpio(void) {\n        return my_configured_lightswitch_io();\n   }  So where did the number  5  come from.  Their BSP already includes the specific\nMCU that they are using. And their  mcu/xxx/hal_gpio.c  already defines \nthe mapping between physical pins and the virtual device ids.    The user can determine (when writing code) from their boards physical pinmap \nand from the  hal_gpio.c  MCU mapping which virtual device_id corresponds \nto the correct physical pin in their system.",

You append entries to the end, and read data from the beginning.\n\n\nDescription\n\n\nElements in the flash contain the length of the element, the data within the element, and checksum over the element contents.\n\n\nStorage of elements in flash is done in a FIFO fashion. When user requests space for the next element, space is located at the end of the used area. When user starts reading, the first element served is the oldest element in flash.\n\n\nElements can be appended to the end of the area until storage space is exhausted. User has control over what happens next; either erase oldest block of data, thereby freeing up some space, or stop writing new data until existing data has been collected. FCB treats underlying storage as an array of flash sectors; when it erases old data, it does this a sector at a time.\n\n\nElements in the flash are checksummed. That is how FCB detects whether writing element to flash completed ok. It will skip over entries which don't have a valid checksum.\n\n\nUsage\n\n\nTo add an element to circular buffer:\n\n\n\n\nCall fcb_append() to get the location where data can be written. If this fails due to lack of space, you can call fcb_rotate() to make some. And then call fcb_append() again.\n\n\nUse flash_area_write() to write element contents.\n\n\nCall fcb_append_finish() when done. This completes the entry by calculating the checksum.\n\n\n\n\nTo read contents of the circular buffer:\n\n Call fcb_walk() with a pointer to your callback function.\n\n Within callback function copy in data from the element using flash_area_read(). You can tell when all data from within a sector has been read by monitoring returned element's area pointer. Then you can call fcb_rotate(), if you're done with that data.\n\n\nAlternatively:\n\n Call fcb_getnext() with 0 in element offset to get the pointer to oldest element.\n\n Use flash_area_read() to read element contents.\n* Call fcb_getnext() with pointer to current element to get the next one. And so on.\n\n\nData structures\n\n\nThis data structure describes the element location in the flash. You would use it figure out what parameters to pass to flash_area_read() to read element contents.

When building stats, the implementer chooses the size of the \nstatistic depending on the frequency of the statistic and the \nresolution required before the counter wraps.    \n\n\nTypically the stats are incremented upon code events; however, they are \nnot limted to that purpose.  \n\n\nStats are organized into sections. Each section of stats has its own\nname and can be queried separately through the API.  Each section of stats\nalso has its own statistic size, allowing the user to separate large (64-bit)\nstatistics from small (16 bit statistics).  NOTE:  It is not currently possible\nto group different size stats into the same section.  Please ensure all stats\nin a section have the same size.\n\n\nStats sections are currently stored in a single global stats group.  \n\n\nStatistics are stored in a simple structure which contains a small\nstats header followed by a list of stats.

It also allows an application to control the output destinations\nof logs. \n\n\n\n\nCompile Time Settings\n\n\nTo save space at compile time, there is a compile time log level that\nincludes/excludes certain logs at compile time, saving image space.  For \nexample, during debug, you can have significant logs present, but disable\nthese at compile time to ensure the code size limits are met.\n\n\nA compiler flag \nLOG_LEVEL\n can be set  in your \ntarget.cflags\n or within\nyour app \npkg.cflags\n files to set the compile time log level.   The \nlog level are defined in \napache-mynewt-core/sys/log/include/log/log.h\n\nbut must be added by number to your \nyml\n file.\n\n\nFor example:\n\n\n    pkg.cflags -DLOG_LEVEL=8\n\n\n\n\n\nor \n\n\n    newt target set my_target cflags=-DLOG_LEVEL=8\n\n\n\n\n\nwould both set the compile-time log level to \nLOG_LEVEL_ERROR\n.

The log package comes with two pre-built log handlers.\n\n\n\n\nconsole -- streams log events directly to the console port.  Does\nnot support walking and reading.\n\n\ncbmem -- writes/reads log events to a circular buffer.  Supports walking \nand reading for access by \nnewtmgr\n and shell commands.\n\n\n\n\nIn addition, it is possible to create custom log handlers for other methods.\nExamples may include\n\n\n\n\nFlash file system\n\n\nFlat flash buffer\n\n\nStreamed over some other interface\n\n\n\n\nTo use logging, you will not typically need to create your own log handler.\nYou can use one of the two supplied above. \n\n\nIn Mynewt today, each module will register its logs with a default log handler.\nIts up to the application to use or override this log handler for its \nspecific purposes.

We will call this target \"ble_tgt\". Type the \nnewt target create ble_tgt\n command. You should get this:\n\n\n~/dev/my_proj1$ newt target create ble_tgt\nTarget targets/ble_tgt successfully created\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat this command just did was to create a directory called \nble_tgt\n in the targets directory of your project. Two files are created in that directory: pkg.yml and target.yml.\n\n\nThe target is not yet complete though! We need to set some target variables for this project. Currently, the nimble stack has been ported to the Nordic nrf5x chipsets; specifically the nrf51 and nrf52. This application will use the nrf52 but we will also show the setup for the nrf51 in case your project uses that chip.\n\n\nHere is the command you will need to set up your target for the nrf52:\n\n\n~/dev/my_proj1$ newt target set ble_tgt     \\\n    app=apps/ble_app                        \\\n    bsp=@apache-mynewt-core/hw/bsp/nrf52pdk \\\n    build_profile=optimized\nTarget targets/ble_tgt successfully set target.app to apps/ble_app\nTarget targets/ble_tgt successfully set target.bsp to @apache-mynewt-core/hw/bsp/nrf52pdk\nTarget targets/ble_tgt successfully set target.build_profile to optimized\n\n\n\n\n\nHere is the command you will need to set up your target for the nrf51:\n\n\n~/dev/my_proj1$ newt target set ble_tgt     \\\n    app=apps/ble_app                        \\\n    bsp=@apache-mynewt-core/hw/bsp/nrf51dk  \\\n    build_profile=optimized\nTarget targets/ble_tgt successfully set target.app to apps/ble_app\nTarget targets/ble_tgt successfully set target.bsp to @apache-mynewt-core/hw/bsp/nrf51dk\nTarget targets/ble_tgt successfully set target.build_profile to optimized\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNimble stack initialization\n\n\nThere are certain stack initialization steps that are required for a BLE application to be up and running. If you are running a canned example (e.g. bletiny), these steps are already done for you. When you are writing your own app, you may want to assign different initial values or initialize additional packages that you may have added to your project or written yourself. \n\n\nDetails of the initialization step requirements are covered in \nInitialize Stack\n step.\n\n\n\n\nBuilding the application\n\n\nNow that we have created the application and the target we can build it and test it out. The command you need to run is the \nnewt build\n command with the target we created (\nble_tgt\n). The output will show the files being compiled and linked. You should see this when all is done (except for the \n...\n of course):\n\n\n~/dev/my_proj1$ newt build ble_tgt\n...\nArchiving os.a\nCompiling cons_fmt.c\nCompiling cons_tty.c\nArchiving full.a\nLinking ble_app.elf\nApp successfully built: /Users/wes/dev/my_proj1/bin/ble_tgt/apps/ble_app/ble_app.elf\n\n\n\n\n\nConclusion\n\n\nYou now have a fully functional BLE app (never mind the fact that it doesn't\nactually do anything yet!).  With all the necessary infrastructure in place,\nyou can now start turning this into a real application.  Additional tutorials\nwith focus on adding application-layer functionality to your Nimble application\nwill be coming soon.  In the meantime, you might get some inspiration from\napache-mynewt-core's example Nimble apps.

The host encompasses several layers of the Bluetooth specification that each defines its own set of status codes.  Rather than \"abstract away\" information from lower layers that the application developer might find useful, the NimBLE host aims to indicate precisely what happened when something fails.  Consequently, the host utilizes a rather large set of return codes.\n\n\nA return code of 0 indicates success.  For failure conditions, the return codes are partitioned into five separate sets:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSet\n\n\nCondition\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCore\n\n\nErrors detected internally by the NimBLE host.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nATT\n\n\nThe ATT server has reported a failure via the transmission of an ATT Error Response.  The return code corresponds to the value of the Error Code field in the response.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHCI\n\n\nThe controller has reported an error to the host via a command complete or command status HCI event.  The return code corresponds to the value of the Status field in the event.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nL2CAP\n\n\nAn L2CAP signalling procedure has failed and an L2CAP Command Reject was sent as a result.  The return code corresponds to the value of the Reason field in the command.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSecurity manager (us)\n\n\nThe host detected an error during a security manager procedure and sent a Pairing Failed command to the peer.  The return code corresponds to the value of the Reason field in the Pairing Failed command.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSecurity manager (peer)\n\n\nA security manager procedure failed because the peer sent us a Pairing Failed command.  The return code corresponds to the value of the Reason field in the Pairing Failed command.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe return codes in the core set are defined by the NimBLE Host.  The other sets are defined in the Bluetooth specification; the codes in this latter group are referred to as \nformal status codes\n.  As defined in the Bluetooth specification, the formal status code sets are not disjoint.  That is, they overlap.  For example, the spec defines a status code of 1 to have all of the following meanings:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLayer\n\n\nMeaning\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nATT\n\n\nInvalid handle.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHCI\n\n\nUnknown HCI command.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nL2CAP\n\n\nSignalling MTU exceeded.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSM\n\n\nPasskey entry failed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClearly, the host can't just return an unadorned formal status code and expect the application to make sense of it.  To resolve this ambiguity, the NimBLE host divides the full range of an int into several subranges.  Each subrange corresponds to one of the five return code sets.  For example, the ATT set is mapped onto the subrange \n[0x100, 0x200)\n.  To indicate an ATT error of 3 (write not permitted), the NimBLE host returns a value 0x103 to the application.\n\n\nThe host defines a set of convenience macros for converting from a formal status code to NimBLE host status code.  These macros are documented in the table below.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMacro\n\n\nStatus code set\n\n\nBase value\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBLE_HS_ATT_ERR()\n\n\nATT\n\n\n0x100\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBLE_HS_HCI_ERR()\n\n\nHCI\n\n\n0x200\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBLE_HS_L2C_ERR()\n\n\nL2CAP\n\n\n0x300\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBLE_HS_SM_US_ERR()\n\n\nSecurity manager (us)\n\n\n0x400\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBLE_HS_SM_PEER_ERR()\n\n\nSecurity manager (peer)\n\n\n0x500\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample\n\n\nThe following example demonstrates how an application might determine which error is being reported by the host.  In this example, the application performs the GAP encryption procedure and checks the return code.  To simplify the example, the application uses a hypothetical \nmy_blocking_enc_proc()\n function, which blocks until the pairing operation has completed.\n\n\nvoid\n\n\nencrypt_connection\n(\nuint16_t\n \nconn_handle\n)\n{\n    \nint\n \nrc\n;\n\n    \n/* Perform a blocking GAP encryption procedure. */\n\n    \nrc\n \n=\n \nmy_blocking_enc_proc\n(\nconn_handle\n);\n    \nswitch\n (\nrc\n) {\n    \ncase\n \n0\n:\n\n        \nconsole_printf\n(\nsuccess - link successfully encrypted\\n\n);\n        \nbreak\n;\n\n    \ncase\n \nBLE_HS_ENOTCONN\n:\n        \nconsole_printf\n(\nfailure - no connection with handle %d\\n\n,\n                       \nconn_handle\n);\n        \nbreak\n;\n\n    \ncase\n \nBLE_HS_ERR_SM_US_BASE\n(\nBLE_SM_ERR_CONFIRM_MISMATCH\n)\n:\n\n        \nconsole_printf\n(\nfailure - mismatch in peer\ns confirm and random \n\n                       \ncommands.\\n\n);\n        \nbreak\n;\n\n    \ncase\n \nBLE_HS_ERR_SM_PEER_BASE\n(\nBLE_SM_ERR_CONFIRM_MISMATCH\n)\n:\n\n        \nconsole_printf\n(\nfailure - peer reports mismatch in our confirm and \n\n                       \nrandom commands.\\n\n);\n        \nbreak\n;\n\n    \ndefault\n:\n\n        \nconsole_printf\n(\nfailure - other error: 0x%04x\\n\n, \nrc\n);\n        \nbreak\n;\n    }\n}\n\n\n\n\n\nReturn Code Reference\n\n\nReturn codes - Core\n\n\nThe precise meaning of each of these error codes depends on the function that returns it.

            "text": "The NimBLE host reports status to the application via a set of return codes.  The host encompasses several layers of the Bluetooth specification that each defines its own set of status codes.  Rather than \"abstract away\" information from lower layers that the application developer might find useful, the NimBLE host aims to indicate precisely what happened when something fails.  Consequently, the host utilizes a rather large set of return codes.  A return code of 0 indicates success.  For failure conditions, the return codes are partitioned into five separate sets:     Set  Condition      Core  Errors detected internally by the NimBLE host.    ATT  The ATT server has reported a failure via the transmission of an ATT Error Response.  The return code corresponds to the value of the Error Code field in the response.    HCI  The controller has reported an error to the host via a command complete or command status HCI event.  The return code corresponds to the value of the Status field in the event.    L2CAP  An L2CAP signalling procedure has failed and an L2CAP Command Reject was sent as a result.  The return code corresponds to the value of the Reason field in the command.    Security manager (us)  The host detected an error during a security manager procedure and sent a Pairing Failed command to the peer.  The return code corresponds to the value of the Reason field in the Pairing Failed command.    Security manager (peer)  A security manager procedure failed because the peer sent us a Pairing Failed command.  The return code corresponds to the value of the Reason field in the Pairing Failed command.     The return codes in the core set are defined by the NimBLE Host.  The other sets are defined in the Bluetooth specification; the codes in this latter group are referred to as  formal status codes .  As defined in the Bluetooth specification, the formal status code sets are not disjoint.  That is, they overlap.  For example, the spec defines a status code of 1 to have all of the following meanings:     Layer  Meaning      ATT  Invalid handle.    HCI  Unknown HCI command.    L2CAP  Signalling MTU exceeded.    SM  Passkey entry failed.     Clearly, the host can't just return an unadorned formal status code and expect the application to make sense of it.  To resolve this ambiguity, the NimBLE host divides the full range of an int into several subranges.  Each subrange corresponds to one of the five return code sets.  For example, the ATT set is mapped onto the subrange  [0x100, 0x200) .  To indicate an ATT error of 3 (write not permitted), the NimBLE host returns a value 0x103 to the application.  The host defines a set of convenience macros for converting from a formal status code to NimBLE host status code.  These macros are documented in the table below.     Macro  Status code set  Base value      BLE_HS_ATT_ERR()  ATT  0x100    BLE_HS_HCI_ERR()  HCI  0x200    BLE_HS_L2C_ERR()  L2CAP  0x300    BLE_HS_SM_US_ERR()  Security manager (us)  0x400    BLE_HS_SM_PEER_ERR()  Security manager (peer)  0x500",

It is a simple shell application which provides a basic interface to the host-side of the BLE stack. \"bletiny\" includes all the possible roles (Central/Peripheral) and they may be run simultaneously. You can run bletiny on a board and issue commands that make it behave as a central or a peripheral with different peers. \n\n\nHighlighted below are some of the ways you can use the API to establish connections and discover services and characteristics from peer devices. For descriptions of the full API, go to the next sections on \nGAP in bletiny\n and \nGATT in bletiny\n.\n\n\n\n\nSet device public address.\n\n\nCurrently the device public address is hardcoded to \n0a:0b:0c:0d:0e:0f\n in \nbletiny\n app but you can change it by going into its source code and initializing it to the desired value as described in the section on how to \ninitialize device addr\n. \n\n\n\n\nInitiate a direct connection to a device\n\n\nIn this case, your board is acting as a central and initiating a connection with another BLE device.

            "text": "Newt Tool\n\n\nIntroduction\n\n\nNewt is a smart build and package management system for embedded contexts.  It is a single tool that accomplishes both the following goals:\n\n\n\n\nsource package management \n\n\nbuild, debug and install.\n\n\n\n\nRationale\n\n\nIn order for the Mynewt operating system to work well for constrained environments across the many different types of microcontroller applications (from doorbells to medical devices to power grids), a system is needed that lets you select which packages to install and which packages to build.\n\n\nThe build systems for embedded devices are often fairly complicated and not well served for this purpose.  For example, autoconf is designed for detecting system compatibility issues but not well suited when it comes to tasks like:\n\n\n\n\nBuilding for multiple targets\n\n\nDeciding what to build in and what not to build in\n\n\nManaging dependencies between components\n\n\n\n\nFortunately, solutions addressing these very issues can be found in source package management systems in higher level languages such as Javascript \n(Node), Go, PHP and Ruby.  We decided to fuse their source management \nsystems with a make system built for embedded systems and create Newt.\n\n\nBuild System\n\n\nA good build system must allow the user to take a few common steps while developing embedded applications:\n\n\n\n\nGenerate full flash images\n\n\nDownload debug images to a target board using a debugger\n\n\nConditionally compile libraries \n code based upon build settings\n\n\n\n\nNewt can read a directory tree, build a dependency tree, and emit the right build artifacts.  An example newt source tree is in incubator-mynewt-blinky/develop:\n\n\n$ tree -L 3 \n.\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 DISCLAIMER\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 LICENSE\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 NOTICE\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 README.md\n\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 apps\n\n\u2502   \u2514\u2500\u2500 blinky\n\u2502       \u251c\u2500\u2500 pkg.yml\n\u2502       \u2514\u2500\u2500 src\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 project.yml\n\n\u2514\u2500\u2500 targets\n\n     \u251c\u2500\u2500 my_blinky_sim\n     \u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 pkg.yml\n     \u2502   \u2514\u2500\u2500 target.yml\n     \u2514\u2500\u2500 unittest\n         \u251c\u2500\u2500 pkg.yml\n         \u2514\u2500\u2500 target.yml\n\n6 directories, 10 files\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen Newt sees a directory tree that contains a \"project.yml\" file, it is smart enough to recognize it as the base directory of a project, and \nautomatically builds a package tree. It also recognizes two important package directories in the package tree - \"apps\" and \"targets\". More on these directories in \nNewt Theory of Ops\n.\n\n\nWhen Newt is told to build a project, it recursively resolves all package dependencies and generates artifacts that are placed in the bin/ directory at the top-level of the project.

Packages can export APIs they \nimplement, (i.e. pkg.api: hw-hal-impl), and other packages can require \nthose APIs (i.e. pkg.req_api: hw-hal-impl).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Features\" options are supported.  Packages can change what dependencies \nthey have, or what flags they are using based upon what features are enabled in the system.  As an example, many packages will add additional software, based on whether the shell package is present.  To do this, they can overwrite cflags or deps based upon the shell \"feature.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\npkg.cflags.SHELL: -DSHELL_PRESENT\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn order to properly resolve all dependencies in the build system, Newt recursively processes the package dependencies until there are no new dependencies or features (because features can add dependencies.)  And it builds a big list of all the packages that need to be build.\n\n\nNewt then goes through this package list, and builds every package into \nan archive file.\n\n\nNOTE:\n The Newt tool generates compiler dependencies for all of these packages, and only rebuilds the packages whose dependencies have changed. Changes in package \n project dependencies are also taken into account. It is smart, after all!\n\n\nProducing artifacts\n\n\nOnce Newt has built all the archive files, it then links the archive files together.  The linkerscript to use is specified by the board support package (BSP.)\n\n\nNOTE: One common use of the \"features\" option above is to overwrite \nwhich linkerscript is used, based upon whether or not the BSP is being \nbuild for a raw image, bootable image or bootloader itself.\n\n\nThe newt tool places all of it's artifacts into the bin/ directory at \nthe top-level of the project, prefixed by the target name being built, \nfor example:\n\n\n$ tree -L 4 bin/\nbin/\n\u2514\u2500\u2500 my_blinky_sim\n     \u251c\u2500\u2500 apps\n     \u2502   \u2514\u2500\u2500 blinky\n     \u2502       \u251c\u2500\u2500 blinky.a\n     \u2502       \u251c\u2500\u2500 blinky.a.cmd\n     \u2502       \u251c\u2500\u2500 blinky.elf\n     \u2502       \u251c\u2500\u2500 blinky.elf.cmd\n     \u2502       \u251c\u2500\u2500 blinky.elf.dSYM\n     \u2502       \u251c\u2500\u2500 blinky.elf.lst\n     \u2502       \u251c\u2500\u2500 main.d\n     \u2502       \u251c\u2500\u2500 main.o\n     \u2502       \u2514\u2500\u2500 main.o.cmd\n     \u251c\u2500\u2500 hw\n     \u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 bsp\n     \u2502   \u2502   \u2514\u2500\u2500 native\n     \u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 hal\n     \u2502   \u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 flash_map.d\n     \u2502   \u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 flash_map.o\n\nsnip\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs you can see, a number of files are generated:\n\n\n\n\nArchive File\n\n\n*.cmd: The command use to generate the object or archive file\n\n\n*.lst: The list file where symbols are located\n\n\n*.o The object files that get put into the archive file\n\n\n\n\nDownload/Debug Support\n\n\nOnce a target has been build, there are a number of helper functions \nthat work on the target.  These are:\n\n\n\n\ndownload\n     Download built target to board\n\n\ndebug\n        Open debugger session to target\n\n\nsize         Size of target components\n\n\ncreate-image Add image header to target binary\n\n\n\n\nDownload and debug handles driving GDB and the system debugger.  These \ncommands call out to scripts that are defined by the BSP.\n\n\n$ more repos/apache-mynewt-core/hw/bsp/nrf52pdk/nrf52pdk_debug.sh\n\nsnip\n\n#\nif [ $# -lt 1 ]; then\n     echo \nNeed binary to download\n\n     exit 1\nfi\n\nFILE_NAME=$2.elf\nGDB_CMD_FILE=.gdb_cmds\n\necho \nDebugging\n $FILE_NAME\n\n# Monitor mode.

That way common tools can be used across various development boards and kits.\n\n\nNOTE:\n Both for compiler definitions and debugger scripts, the plan is to \ncreate Dockerizable containers of these toolchains.  This should make \nthings much easier to support across Mac OS X, Linux and Windows.  Newt \nwill know how to call out to Docker to perform these processes.",

To do this, they can overwrite cflags or deps based upon the shell \"feature.\"    pkg.cflags.SHELL: -DSHELL_PRESENT   In order to properly resolve all dependencies in the build system, Newt recursively processes the package dependencies until there are no new dependencies or features (because features can add dependencies.)  And it builds a big list of all the packages that need to be build.  Newt then goes through this package list, and builds every package into \nan archive file.  NOTE:  The Newt tool generates compiler dependencies for all of these packages, and only rebuilds the packages whose dependencies have changed. Changes in package   project dependencies are also taken into account. It is smart, after all!",

You can read about it at \nhttp://www.mkdocs.org\n. Documentation source files are written in Markdown, and configured with a single YAML configuration file. Markdown is a lightweight markup language with plain text formatting syntax designed so that it can be converted to HTML and many other formats using a tool (which in our case is MkDocs).\n\n\nThe HTML pages are generated periodically after changes have been reviewed and accepted into the master branch.\n\n\nAccess to the Apache repo\n\n\nGet an account on Apache. You do not need a committer account to view the website or clone the repository but you need it to push changes to it.\n\n\nIf you are not a committer, you may follow the proposed non-committer workflow to share your work. The direct link to the proposed workflow is \nhttps://git-wip-us.apache.org/docs/workflow.html\n. You will find the steps described in more detail later in this tutorial.\n\n\nEditing an existing page\n\n\n\n\nCreate a fork on the \ngithub mirror\n. \n\n\n\n\nThen create a new branch to work on your documentation and move to that branch.\n\n\n\n\n        $ git checkout -b \nyour-branch-name\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMake changes directly on github.com. Generate a pull request. Alternatively, you can edit locally on your machine, push the branch (or the changes in the branch) to your fork on github.com, and then generate a pull request.\n\n\n\n\nAdding a new page\n\n\nIf you create a new file somewhere in the \ndocs\n subdirectory to add a new page, you have to add a line in the \nmkdocs.yml\n file at the correct level. For example, if you add a new module named \"Wi-Fi\" by creating a new file named \nwifi.md\n in the \nnetwork\n directory, you have to insert the following line under \nNetworking User Guide\n in the \nmkdocs.yml\n file (at the same level as the \ndocs\n directory). In this example, a link will show up in the navigation bar on the left under \"Networking User Guide\" titled \"Wi-Fi\" and take the user to the contents of the 'wifi.md' file when the link is clicked. \n Note: The change will show up on this \nMynewt site\n only after your pull request is merged in and the updated site is generated.\n\n\n        - \nWi-Fi\n: \nwifi.md\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLocal preview of HTML files\n\n\nYou have the option to install MkDocs and do a local conversion yourself to preview the pages using the built-in webserver that comes with MkDocs. In order to install MkDocs you'll need Python installed on your system, as well as the Python package manager, pip. You can check if you have them already (usually you will).\n\n\n        $ python --version\n        Python 2.7.2\n        $ pip --version\n        pip 1.5.2\n        $ pip install mkdocs\n\n\n\n\n\nYou will then run the built-in webserver from the root of the documentation directory using the command \nmkdocs serve\n. The root directory for documentation is \nincubator-mynewt-site\n or the directory with the \nmkdocs.yml\n file.\n\n\n        $ ls\n        docs        images      mkdocs.yml\n        $ mkdocs serve\n\n\n\n\n\nThen go to \nhttp://127.0.0.1:8000\n to preview your pages and see how they will look on the website. \nRemember that the Myself website itself will not be updated.\n\n\nFor more information on MkDocs go to \nhttp://www.mkdocs.org\n.",
