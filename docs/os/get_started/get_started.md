## Quick Start

If you are curious about Mynewt and want to get a quick feel for the project, you've come to the right place. We have two options for you:

<br>

**Option 1** allows you to install the Newt tool, instances of the Mynewt OS (for simulated targets), and toolchains for developing embedded software (e.g. GNU toolchain) natively on your laptop or computer. You may want this if you are already familiar with such environments or are concerned about performance on your machine. Follow the instructions to [install native tools](native_tools.md) and [install cross tools for ARM](cross_tools.md) if you prefer this option.


**Option 2** is a bundled option to get up and running with Mynewt for a quick look at the OS. The Newt tool and build toolchains are all available in a single [All-in-one Docker Container](docker.md) that you can install on your laptop or computer.

<br>


You can then proceed with the instructions on how to 
* [Create Your First Project](project_create.md) - on simulated hardware.

Upon successful start, several tutorials await your eager attention!
