## Sensor Tutorials Overview

This set of sensor tutorials allows you to explore the Mynewt Sensor Framework features and learn how to develop sensor enabled Mynewt applications.

The Mynewt Sensor framework supports:

* Onboard and off board sensors.
* Retrieving sensor data and controlling sensor devices via the Mynewt OS Shell
* Retrieving sensor data over the OIC protocol and BLE transport.


### Available Tutorials

The tutorials are:

* [Enabling an Off Board Sensor in an Existing Application](/os/tutorials/sensors/sensor_nrf52_bno055.md). This tutorial allows you to quickly bring up a sensor enabled application that retrieves data from a sensor device. We recommend that you work through this tutorial before trying one of the other tutorials.

* [Writing an Appliation for an Onboard Sensor](/os/tutorials/sensor_thingy_accelerator.md). This tutorial shows you how to develop a simple application for an device with an onboard sensor.

* [Enabling OIC Sensor Data Monitoring in an Existing Application](/os/tutorials/sensors/sensor_oic_nrf52_bno055.md). This tutorial shows you how to enable support for sensor data monitoring via OIC in an existing application.

### Prerequisites
Ensure that you meet the following prerequisites before continuing with one of the tutorials. 

* Have Internet connectivity to fetch remote Mynewt components.
* Have a computer to build a Mynewt application and connect to the board over USB.
* Have a Micro-USB cable to connect the board and the computer.
* Install the newt tool and toolchains (See [Basic Setup](/os/get_started/get_started.md)).
* Read the Mynewt OS [Concepts](/os/get_started/vocabulary.md) section. 
* Create a project space (directory structure) and populate it with the core code repository (apache-mynewt-core) explained in [Creating Your First Project](/os/get_started/project_create).
* Work through one of the [Blinky Tutorials](/os/tutorials/blinky.md).
