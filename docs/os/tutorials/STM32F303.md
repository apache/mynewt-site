## Blinky, your "Hello World!", on STM32F303 Discovery

<br>

### Objective

Learn how to use packages from a default application repository of Mynewt to build your first *Hello World* application (Blinky) on a target board. Once built using the *newt* tool, this application will blink the LED lights on the target board.

Create a project with a simple app that blinks an LED on the stmf303 
discovery board.  In the process import some external libraries into your project. Download the application to the target and watch it blink!

<br>

### What you need

* Discovery kit with STM32F303VC MCU
* Laptop running Mac OSX. 
* It is assumed you have already installed newt tool. 
* It is assumed you already installed native tools as described [here](../get_started/native_tools.md)

Also, we assume that you're familiar with UNIX shells. Let's gets started!

<br>

### Create a project

Create a new project to hold your work.  For a deeper understanding, you can read about project creation in 
[Get Started -- Creating Your First Project](../get_started/project_create.md)
or just follow the commands below.

If you've already created a project from another tutorial, you can re-use
that project.

```
$ mkdir ~/dev
$ cd ~/dev
$ newt new myproj
Downloading project skeleton from apache/incubator-mynewt-blinky...
Installing skeleton in myproj...
Project myproj successfully created.

$ cd myproj

``` 

**Note:** Don't forget to change into the `myproj` directory.

<br>

### Import External STM32F3 Library support 

The STM32F303 support for Mynewt lives in an external repository.  It's
necessary to add another repository to the project.  To do this,
edit the file `project.yml` in the root directory of your project `myproj`

This requires two changes to this file.

1.  You must define the properties of the external repository that you want
to add
2. You must include the repository in your project.

Edit the file `project.yml` with your favorite editor and add the 
following repository details in the file (after the core 
repository).  This gives newt the information to contact the repository
and extract its contents.  In this case, the repository is on github in 
the `runtimeinc` collection. Its name is `mynewt-stm32f3` and we will accept
any version up to the latest. You can look at the contents [here](https://github.com/runtimeinc/mynewt_stm32f3).

```
repository.mynewt_stm32f3:
    type: github
    vers: 0-latest
    user: runtimeinc
    repo: mynewt_stm32f3
```

<br>

In the same file, add the following highlighted line to the 
`project.repositories` variable.  This tells newt to download the
 repository contents into your project. 

```hl_lines="3"
project.repositories:
    - apache-mynewt-core
    - mynewt_stm32f3
```

<br>

### Install dependencies

Now you can install this into the project using:

```
$ newt install -v 
Downloading repository description for apache-mynewt-core... success!
...
apache-mynewt-core successfully installed version 0.7.9-none
...
Downloading repository description for mynewt_stm32f3... success!
Downloading repository mynewt_stm32f3 
...
Resolving deltas: 100% (65/65), done.
Checking connectivity... done.
mynewt_stm32f3 successfully installed version 0.0.0-none
```

<br>

   
### Create  targets

Create two targets to build using the stmf3 board support package and the 
app blinky example from mynewt.  The output of these commands are not
shown here for brevity. 

The first target is the application image itself. The second
target is the bootloader which allows you to upgrade your mynewt 
applications. 


```
$ newt target create stmf3_blinky
$ newt target set stmf3_blinky build_profile=optimized
$ newt target set stmf3_blinky bsp=@mynewt_stm32f3/hw/bsp/stm32f3discovery
$ newt target set stmf3_blinky app=apps/blinky

$ newt target create stmf3_boot
$ newt target set stmf3_boot app=@apache-mynewt-core/apps/boot
$ newt target set stmf3_boot bsp=@mynewt_stm32f3/hw/bsp/stm32f3discovery
$ newt target set stmf3_boot build_profile=optimized

$ newt target show

targets/stmf3_blinky
    app=apps/blinky
    bsp=@mynewt_stm32f3/hw/bsp/stm32f3discovery
    build_profile=optimized
targets/stmf3_boot
    app=apps/boot
    bsp=@mynewt_stm32f3/hw/bsp/stm32f3discovery
    build_profile=optimized
```

<br>

### Build the images

To build the images, use the `newt build` command below.

```
$ newt build stmf3_blinky
   ...
Archiving stm32f3discovery.a
Linking blinky.elf
App successfully built: ~/dev/myproj/bin/stmf3_blinky/apps/blinky/blinky.elf

$ newt build stmf3_boot
Compiling log_shell.c
Archiving log.a
Linking boot.elf
App successfully built: ~/dev/myproj/bin/stmf3_boot/apps/boot/boot.elf
```

<br>

### Create an application image from the binary

You must sign and version your application image to download it using newt.  Use
the `newt create-image` command to perform this action. Here we assign this
image an arbitrary version `1.2.3`.

```no-highlight
$ newt create-image stmf3_blinky 1.2.3
App image succesfully generated: ~/dev/myproj/bin/stmf3_blinky/apps/blinky/blinky.img
Build manifest:~/dev/myproj/bin/stmf3_blinky/apps/blinky/manifest.json
```

<br>

### Configure the hardware 


 The STM32F3DISCOVERY board includes an ST-LINK/V2 embedded debug tool interface that will be used to program/debug the board. To program the MCU on the board, simply plug in the two jumpers on CN4, as shown in the picture in red. If you want to learn more about the board you will find the User Manual at [http://www.st.com/st-web-ui/static/active/jp/resource/technical/document/user_manual/DM00063382.pdf](http://www.st.com/st-web-ui/static/active/jp/resource/technical/document/user_manual/DM00063382.pdf)

### Download the Images

Use the `newt load` command to download the images to the target board.

```
$ newt -v load stmf3_boot
$ newt -v load stmf3_blinky
``` 

<br>

### Watch the LED blink

Congratulations! You have built, downloaded, and run your first application using mynewt for the
stf32f3 discovery board. One of the LEDs on the LED wheel should be blinking 
at 1 Hz.
