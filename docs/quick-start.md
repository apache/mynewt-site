### Get set

Apache Mynewt currently offers two ways to quickly get set up, each appealing to different personal preferences and levels of familiarity with embedded systems.

<br>

*   **Option 1:** Step-by-step instructions to install the Newt tool, developer toolchains and libraries natively on your computer. This is the recommended option. For this option, go to [Native Setup](/latest/get_started/native_install/)

*   **Option 2:** All-in-one docker container that bundles Newt tool, developer toolchains and libraries. This option is only for a quick look at the project. For this option, go to [Docker instructions](/latest/get_started/docker.html)

<br>

### Go!

Start a new project as explained under [Create Your First Project](/latest/get_started/project_create.html). The core Mynewt OS is automatically downloaded as part of the project installation.

<br>

*   When you [Create Your First Project](/latest/get_started/project_create.html) you define a simulated target and run Project Blinky, the Hello World equivalent in the embedded world.

*   If you have one of the supported [boards](/#supported_boards), you can make real LEDs blink in [Project Blinky](/latest/tutorials/blinky/blinky.html). Simply choose the appropriate tutorial for the board and proceed.
