Overview
^^^^^^^^

*bleprph* is an example app included in the apache-mynewt-nimble
repository. This app implements a simple BLE peripheral with the
following properties:

-  Supports three services: GAP, GATT, and alert notification service
   (ANS).
-  Supports a single concurrent connection.
-  Automatically advertises connectability when not connected to a
   central device.

This tutorial aims to provide a guided tour through the *bleprph* app
source code. This document builds on some concepts described elsewhere
in the Apache Mynewt documentation. Before proceeding with this
tutorial, you might want to familiarize yourself with the following
pages:

-  :doc:`Create Your First Mynewt Project <../../../get_started/project_create>`
-  :doc:`BLE Bare Bones Application Tutorial <../ble_bare_bones>`
-  :doc:`NimBLE Stack Initialization <../../../network/ble/ini_stack/ble_ini_intro>`

Services, Characteristics, Descriptors
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

A BLE peripheral interfaces with other BLE devices by exposing
*services*, *characteristics*, and *descriptors*. All three of these
entities are implemented at a lower layer via *attributes*. If you are
not familiar with these concepts, you will probably want to check out
`overview <https://www.bluetooth.com/specifications/gatt/generic-attributes-overview>`__
from the Bluetooth Developer's site before proceeding.

Now let's dig in to some C code.
