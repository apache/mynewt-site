The tutorials in this section will help you get started with Mynewt's BLE stack called "NimBLE". The first tutorial simply explains how to define a new (albeit empty) application for your target. The tutorials get progressively complex, explaining how to write your own beacon, leverage an example application from the repository to make your own end device (peripheral), use the HCI interface etc. 

These tutorials assume that you have already installed the newt tool and are familiar with its concepts. And as always, contributions to this section are very welcome!
