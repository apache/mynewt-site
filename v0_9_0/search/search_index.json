The essential steps to setting up your project space for working with the latest code from \"develop\" and make pull requests into \"develop\" to get your code added are the following: Step 1: Create a fork of the entire Mynewt repository on github.com. Step 2: Setup repository on your laptop to use code in \u201cdevelop\u201d branch. You then create a new branch \u201cmybranch\u201d using \u201cgit checkout \u2013b\u201d. You also add a remote handle named \u201cfork\u201d that points to the github fork you created in Step 1. $ newt new devproject $ cd devproject $ vi project.yml # change version to 0-dev for repository.apache-mynewt-core $ newt install $ cd repos/apache-mynewt-core $ git status On branch develop Your branch is up-to-date with 'origin/develop'. nothing to commit, working directory clean $ git checkout \u2013b mybranch $ git remote -v origin https://github.com/apache/incubator-mynewt-core.git (fetch) origin https://github.com/apache/incubator-mynewt-core.git (push) $ git remote add fork https://github.com/<user>/incubator-mynewt-core $ git remote -v origin https://github.com/apache/incubator-mynewt-core.git (fetch) origin https://github.com/apache/incubator-mynewt-core.git (push) fork https://github.com/<user>/incubator-mynewt-core (fetch) fork https://github.com/<user>/incubator-mynewt-core (push) Step 3: Check you are in \u201cmybranch\u201d.

Markdown, MkDocs, Mou The Mynewt documentation you see on the Apache incubator website is a bunch of HTML files generated using MkDocs which is a simple static site generation tool geared towards building project documentation. You can read about it at http://www.mkdocs.org . Documentation source files are written in Markdown, and configured with a single YAML configuration file. Markdown is a lightweight markup language with plain text formatting syntax designed so that it can be converted to HTML and many other formats using a tool (which in our case is MkDocs). The HTML pages are generated periodically after changes have been reviewed and accepted into the master branch. Access to the Apache repo Get an account on Apache. You do not need a committer account to view the website or clone the repository but you need it to push changes to it. If you are not a committer, you may follow the proposed non-committer workflow to share your work. The direct link to the proposed workflow is https://git-wip-us.apache.org/docs/workflow.html . You will find the steps described in more detail later in this tutorial. Editing an existing page Create a fork on the github mirror . Then create a new branch to work on your documentation and move to that branch. $ git checkout -b <your-branch-name> Make changes directly on github.com. Generate a pull request. Alternatively, you can edit locally on your machine, push the branch (or the changes in the branch) to your fork on github.com, and then generate a pull request. Adding a new page If you create a new file somewhere in the docs subdirectory to add a new page, you have to add a line in the mkdocs.yml file at the correct level. For example, if you add a new module named \"Wi-Fi\" by creating a new file named wifi.md in the network directory, you have to insert the following line under Networking User Guide in the mkdocs.yml file (at the same level as the docs directory). In this example, a link will show up in the navigation bar on the left under \"Networking User Guide\" titled \"Wi-Fi\" and take the user to the contents of the 'wifi.md' file when the link is clicked. Note: The change will show up on this Mynewt site only after your pull request is merged in and the updated site is generated. - 'Wi-Fi': 'wifi.md' Local preview of HTML files You have the option to install MkDocs and do a local conversion yourself to preview the pages using the built-in webserver that comes with MkDocs. In order to install MkDocs you'll need Python installed on your system, as well as the Python package manager, pip. You can check if you have them already (usually you will). $ python --version Python 2.7.2 $ pip --version pip 1.5.2 $ pip install mkdocs You will then run the built-in webserver from the root of the documentation directory using the command mkdocs serve . The root directory for documentation is incubator-mynewt-site or the directory with the mkdocs.yml file. $ ls docs images mkdocs.yml $ mkdocs serve Then go to http://127.0.0.1:8000 to preview your pages and see how they will look on the website.

It is called NimBLE. BLE technology operates in the unlicensed industrial, scientific and medical (ISM) band at 2.4 to 2.485 GHz which is available in most countries. It uses a spread spectrum, frequency hopping, full-duplex signal. BLE FHSS employs 40 2-MHz-wide channels to ensure greater reliability over longer distances. It also features 0-dBm (1 mW) power output and a typical maximum range of 50 meters. Note that BLE is not compatible with standard Bluetooth. Features NimBLE complies with Bluetooth Core Specification 4.2 which introduces several new features that make it an ideal wireless technology for the Internet of Things (IoT). LE Privacy 1.2 for frequent changes to the device address to make it difficult to track for outsiders Roadmap LE Secure Connections featuring FIPS-compliant algorithms. Roadmap LE Data Length Extension for higher throughput Available now Enables users to assign an Internet Protocol (IP) address (complaint with the IPv6 or 6LoWPAN standard) to a Bluetooth device through Internet Protocol Support Profile (IPSP) Roadmap NimBLE supports features from older specifications including, Support multiple roles (master(central)/slave(peripheral), server/client) simultaneously Support simultaneous advertising and scanning Support being slave to multiple masters simultaneously (subject to memory and scheduling constraints) Low Duty Cycle Directed Advertising Connection parameters request procedure LE Ping 32 bits UUID L2CAP Connection Oriented Channels Components A Bluetooth low energy stack (NimBLE included) consists of two components with several subcomponents: Controller Physical Layer : adaptive frequency-hopping Gaussian Frequency Shift Keying (GFSK) radio using 40 RF channels (0-39), with 2 MHz spacing. Link Layer : with one of five states (Standby, Advertising, Scanning, Initiating, Connection states) active at any time Host Logical Link Control and Adaptation Protocol (L2CAP) : provides logical channels, named L2CAP channels, which are multiplexed over one or more logical links to provide packet segmentation and reassembly, flow control, error control, streaming, QoS etc. Security Manager (SM) : uses Security Manager Protocol (SMP) for pairing and transport specific key distribution for securing radio communication Attribute protocol (ATT) : allows a device ( Server ) to expose certain pieces of data, known as Attributes , to another device ( Client ) Generic Attribute Profile (GATT) : a framework for using the ATT protocol to exchange attributes encapsulated as Characteristics or Services Generic Access Profile (GAP) : a base profile which all Bluetooth devices implement, which in the case of LE, defines the Physical Layer, Link Layer, L2CAP, Security Manager, Attribute Protocol and Generic Attribute Profile. Host Controller Interface (HCI) : the interface between the host and controller either through software API or by a hardware interface such as SPI, UART or USB. Subsequent chapters in this manual will go into the details of the implementation of each component, APIs available, and things to consider while designing a NimBLE app. Example NimBLE projects Mynewt comes with two built-in projects that allow users to play with NimBLE, try the tutorials out with, and see how to use available services. bletiny : A simple shell application which provides a basic interface to the host-side of the BLE stack. bleprph : A basic peripheral device with no user interface. It advertises automatically on startup, and resumes advertising whenever a connection is terminated. It supports a maximum of one connection.","title":"NimBLE Introduction"},{"location":"network/ble/ble_intro/#ble-introduction","text":"Apache Mynewt offers the world's first fully open-source Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) or Bluetooth Smart stack.

For detailed specifications, see BLUETOOTH SPECIFICATION Version 4.2 [Vol 1, Part A]. Pairing : The process for creating one or more shared secret keys. In LE a single link key is generated by combining contributions from each device into a link key used during pairing. Bonding : The act of storing the keys created during pairing for use in subsequent connections in order to form a trusted device pair. Bonding is currently a roadmap item for Apache Mynewt. Device authentication : Verification that the two devices have the same keys (verify device identity) Encryption : Keeps message confidential. Encryption in Bluetooth LE uses AES-CCM cryptography and is performed in the Controller . Message integrity : Protects against message forgeries. Bluetooth LE uses four association models depending on the I/O capabilities of the devices. Apache Mynewt has first implemented support for \"Just Works\" only. Just Works : designed for scenarios where at least one of the devices does not have a display capable of displaying a six digit number nor does it have a keyboard capable of entering six decimal digits. Numeric Comparison : designed for scenarios where both devices are capable of displaying a six digit number and both are capable of having the user enter \"yes\" or \"no\". A good example of this model is the cell phone / PC scenario. Out of Band : designed for scenarios where an Out of Band mechanism is used to both discover the devices as well as to exchange or transfer cryptographic numbers used in the pairing process. Passkey Entry : designed for the scenario where one device has input capability but does not have the capability to display six digits and the other device has output capabilities. A good example of this model is the PC and keyboard scenario. Key Generation Key generation for all purposes in Bluetooth LE is performed by the Host on each LE device independent of any other LE device. Privacy Feature Bluetooth LE supports an optional feature during connection mode and connection procedures that reduces the ability to track a LE device over a period of time by changing the Bluetooth device address on a frequent basis. Privacy support is currently a roadmap item for Apache Mynewt. There are two variants of the privacy feature. In the first variant, private addresses are resolved and generated by the Host . In the second variant, private addresses are resolved and generated by the Controller without involving the Host after the Host provides the Controller device identity information. The Host may provide the Controller with a complete resolving list or a subset of the resolving list. Device filtering becomes possible in the second variant when address resolution is performed in the Controller because the peer\u2019s device identity address can be resolved prior to checking whether it is in the white list. Note : When address resolution is performed exclusively in the Host, a device may experience increased power consumption because device filtering must be disabled. For more details on the privacy feature, refer to BLUETOOTH SPECIFICATION Version 4.2 [Vol 3, Part C] (Published 02 December 2014), Page 592.","title":"NimBLE Security"},{"location":"network/ble/ble_sec/#ble-security","text":"The Bluetooth Low Energy security model includes five distinct security concepts as listed below.

Create the target Now you have to create the target that you will use to build your application. We will call this target \"ble_tgt\". Type the newt target create ble_tgt command. You should get this: ~/dev/my_proj1$ newt target create ble_tgt Target targets/ble_tgt successfully created What this command just did was to create a directory called ble_tgt in the targets directory of your project. Two files are created in that directory: pkg.yml and target.yml. The target is not yet complete though! We need to set some target variables for this project. Currently, the nimble stack has been ported to the Nordic nrf5x chipsets; specifically the nrf51 and nrf52. This application will use the nrf52 but we will also show the setup for the nrf51 in case your project uses that chip.

If you are running a canned example (e.g. bletiny), these steps are already done for you. When you are writing your own app, you may want to assign different initial values or initialize additional packages that you may have added to your project or written yourself. Details of the initialization step requirements are covered in Initialize Stack step. Building the application Now that we have created the application and the target we can build it and test it out. The command you need to run is the newt build command with the target we created ( ble_tgt ). The output will show the files being compiled and linked.

It is a single tool that accomplishes both the following goals: source package management build, debug and install. Rationale In order for the Mynewt operating system to work well for constrained environments across the many different types of microcontroller applications (from doorbells to medical devices to power grids), a system is needed that lets you select which packages to install and which packages to build. The build systems for embedded devices are often fairly complicated and not well served for this purpose. For example, autoconf is designed for detecting system compatibility issues but not well suited when it comes to tasks like: Building for multiple targets Deciding what to build in and what not to build in Managing dependencies between components Fortunately, solutions addressing these very issues can be found in source package management systems in higher level languages such as Javascript (Node), Go, PHP and Ruby. We decided to fuse their source management systems with a make system built for embedded systems and create Newt. Build System A good build system must allow the user to take a few common steps while developing embedded applications: Generate full flash images Download debug images to a target board using a debugger Conditionally compile libraries & code based upon build settings Newt can read a directory tree, build a dependency tree, and emit the right build artifacts.

Source Management and Repositories The other major element of the Newt tool is the ability to create reusable source distributions from a collection of code. A project can be a reusable container of source code. In other words, projects can be versioned and redistributed, not packages. A project bundles together packages that are typically needed to work together in a product e.g. RTOS core, filesystem APIs, and networking stack. A project that has been made redistributable is known as a repository . Repositories can be added to your local project by adding them into your project.yml file. Here is an example of the blinky project's yml file which relies on apache-mynewt-core: $ more project.yml <snip> project.repositories: - apache-mynewt-core # Use github's distribution mechanism for core ASF libraries. # This provides mirroring automatically for us. # repository.apache-mynewt-core: type: github vers: 0-latest user: apache repo: incubator-mynewt-core When you specify this repository in the blinky's project file, you can then use the Newt tool to install dependencies: $ newt install Downloading repository description for apache-mynewt-core... success!

You can see that there are two essential package directories, \"apps\" and \"targets.\" \"apps\" Package Directory apps is where applications are stored, and applications are where the main() function is contained. Along with the targets directory, apps represents the top-level of the build tree, and define the dependencies and features for the rest of the system. The app definition is contained in a pkg.yml file. An example of blinky's pkg.yml file is: $ more apps/blinky/pkg.yml <snip> pkg.name: apps/blinky pkg.vers: 0.8.0 pkg.description: Basic example application which blinks an LED. pkg.author: \"Apache Mynewt <dev@mynewt.incubator.apache.org>\" pkg.homepage: \"http://mynewt.apache.org/\" pkg.repository: pkg.keywords: pkg.deps: - \"@apache-mynewt-core/libs/os\" - \"@apache-mynewt-core/hw/hal\" - \"@apache-mynewt-core/libs/console/full\" This file says that the name of the package is apps/blinky, and it depends on libs/os, hw/hal and libs/console/full packages. NOTE: @apache-mynewt-core is a repository descriptor, and this will be covered in the \"repository\" section. \"targets\" Package Directory targets is where targets are stored, and each target is a collection of parameters that must be passed to Newt in order to generate a reproducible build. Along with the apps directory, targets represents the top of the build tree. Any packages or parameters specified at the target level cascades down to all dependencies. Most targets consist of: app: The application to build bsp: The board support package to combine with that application build_profile: Either debug or optimized. The my_blinky_sim target in the example below has the following settings: $ newt target show targets/my_blinky_sim app=apps/blinky bsp=@apache-mynewt-core/hw/bsp/native build_profile=debug $ ls my_blinky_sim/ pkg.yml target.yml In general, the three basic parameters of a target ( app , bsp , and build_profile ) are stored in the target.yml file in that target's build directory under targets . You will also see a pkg.yml file in the same directory. Since targets are packages, a pkg.yml is expected. It contains typical package descriptors, dependencies, and additional parameters such as the following: Cflags: Any additional compiler flags you might want to specify to the build Aflags: Any additional assembler flags you might want to specify to the build Lflags: Any additional linker flags you might want to specify to the build features: Any system level features you want to enable. Resolving dependencies When newt is told to build a project, it will: find the top-level project.yml file recurse the packages in the package tree, and build a list of all source packages Newt then looks at the target that the user set, for example, blinky_sim: $ more targets/my_blinky_sim/ pkg.yml target.yml $ more targets/my_blinky_sim/target.yml ### Target: targets/my_blinky_sim target.app: \"apps/blinky\" target.bsp: \"@apache-mynewt-core/hw/bsp/native\" target.build_profile: \"debug\" The target specifies two major things: Application (target.app): The application to build Board Support Package (target.bsp): The board support package to build along with that application. Newt goes and builds the dependency tree specified by all the packages. While building this tree, it does a few other things: Any package that depends on another package, automatically gets the include directories from the package it includes. Include directories in the newt structure must always be prefixed by the package name. For example, libs/os has the following include tree and its include directory files contains the package name \"os\" before any header files. This is so in order to avoid any header file conflicts. $ tree . \u251c\u2500\u2500 README.md \u251c\u2500\u2500 include \u2502 \u2514\u2500\u2500 os \u2502 \u251c\u2500\u2500 arch \u2502 \u2502 \u251c\u2500\u2500 cortex_m0 \u2502 \u2502 \u2502 \u2514\u2500\u2500 os \u2502 \u2502 \u2502 \u2514\u2500\u2500 os_arch.h \u2502 \u2502 \u251c\u2500\u2500 cortex_m4 \u2502 \u2502 \u2502 \u2514\u2500\u2500 os \u2502 \u2502 \u2502 \u2514\u2500\u2500 os_arch.h \u2502 \u2502 \u2514\u2500\u2500 sim \u2502 \u2502 \u2514\u2500\u2500 os \u2502 \u2502 \u2514\u2500\u2500 os_arch.h \u2502 \u251c\u2500\u2500 endian.h \u2502 \u251c\u2500\u2500 os.h \u2502 \u251c\u2500\u2500 os_callout.h \u2502 \u251c\u2500\u2500 os_cfg.h \u2502 \u251c\u2500\u2500 os_eventq.h \u2502 \u251c\u2500\u2500 os_heap.h \u2502 \u251c\u2500\u2500 os_malloc.h \u2502 \u251c\u2500\u2500 os_mbuf.h \u2502 \u251c\u2500\u2500 os_mempool.h \u2502 \u251c\u2500\u2500 os_mutex.h \u2502 \u251c\u2500\u2500 os_sanity.h \u2502 \u251c\u2500\u2500 os_sched.h \u2502 \u251c\u2500\u2500 os_sem.h \u2502 \u251c\u2500\u2500 os_task.h \u2502 \u251c\u2500\u2500 os_test.h \u2502 \u251c\u2500\u2500 os_time.h \u2502 \u2514\u2500\u2500 queue.h \u251c\u2500\u2500 pkg.yml \u2514\u2500\u2500 src \u251c\u2500\u2500 arch <snip> API requirements are validated. Packages can export APIs they implement, (i.e. pkg.api: hw-hal-impl), and other packages can require those APIs (i.e. pkg.req_api: hw-hal-impl). \"Features\" options are supported. Packages can change what dependencies they have, or what flags they are using based upon what features are enabled in the system. As an example, many packages will add additional software, based on whether the shell package is present. To do this, they can overwrite cflags or deps based upon the shell \"feature.\" pkg.cflags.SHELL: -DSHELL_PRESENT In order to properly resolve all dependencies in the build system, Newt recursively processes the package dependencies until there are no new dependencies or features (because features can add dependencies.) And it builds a big list of all the packages that need to be build. Newt then goes through this package list, and builds every package into an archive file. NOTE: The Newt tool generates compiler dependencies for all of these packages, and only rebuilds the packages whose dependencies have changed. Changes in package & project dependencies are also taken into account. It is smart, after all! Producing artifacts Once Newt has built all the archive files, it then links the archive files together.

Packages can export APIs they implement, (i.e. pkg.api: hw-hal-impl), and other packages can require those APIs (i.e. pkg.req_api: hw-hal-impl). \"Features\" options are supported. Packages can change what dependencies they have, or what flags they are using based upon what features are enabled in the system. As an example, many packages will add additional software, based on whether the shell package is present. To do this, they can overwrite cflags or deps based upon the shell \"feature.\" pkg.cflags.SHELL: -DSHELL_PRESENT In order to properly resolve all dependencies in the build system, Newt recursively processes the package dependencies until there are no new dependencies or features (because features can add dependencies.) And it builds a big list of all the packages that need to be build. Newt then goes through this package list, and builds every package into an archive file.

Install git, libcurl $ sudo apt-get install git $ sudo apt-get install libcurl4-gnutls-dev 2. Install Go, the programming language Go language environment dictates a directory structure. Known in Go parlanace as workspace, it must contain three sibling directories with the directory names src, pkg and bin, as explained below. src contains Go source files organized into packages (one package per directory), pkg contains package objects, and bin contains executable commands. The GOPATH environment variable specifies the location of your workspace. To setup this workspace environment, create a 'dev' directory and then a 'go' directory under it. Set the GOPATH environment variable to this directory where you will soon clone the newt tool repository. $ cd $HOME $ mkdir -p dev/go $ cd dev/go $ export GOPATH=`pwd` (Note that you need to add export statements to ~/.bash_profile to export variables permanently. Don't forget to source the file for the change to go into effect.) $ vi ~/.bash_profile $ source ~/.bash_profile Next, install Go. When installed, Go offers you as a developer a language environment (to compile Go code), construct Go packages (to assemble Go packages) and import Go code (from github). In the next step, you will use the Go commands to import newt repo into your local Go environment. Note : The Newt tool requires Go version 1.5 or later. It uses the support for \"vendoring\" that was added in Go 1.5. Depending on the Ubuntu version you have, the following may install an earlier version. In that case, download the latest package of Go 1.5 or 1.6 from https://golang.org/dl/ . You can search for more detailed instructions such as installing Go 1.6 on Ubuntu 14.04 which can be found at https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-go-1-6-on-ubuntu-14-04 . $ sudo apt-get install golang 3.

Build the Newt tool Use Go to run the newt.go program to build the newt tool. The command go install compiles and writes the resulting executable to an output file named newt , which is then installed, along with its dependencies, in $GOPATH/bin. If you get errors it is likely because of path resolution issues. Try go build followed by go install in that case. $ cd $GOPATH/src/mynewt.apache.org/newt/newt $ go install $ ls \"$GOPATH\"/bin/ newt newtmgr newtvm At this point, you can try using newt . For example, check for the version number by typing 'newt version'. See all the possible commands available to a user of newt by typing 'newt -h'. (Note: If you are going to be modifying the newt often and going to be compile the program every time you call it, you will want to store the command in a variable in your .bash_profile. So type in export newt=\"go run $GOPATH/mynewt.apache.org/newt/newt/newt.go\" in your .bash_profile and execute it by calling $newt at the prompt instead of newt .

Examples of these devices are connected locks, lights, and wearables. Microcontroller environments have a number of characteristics that makes the operating system requirements for them unique: Low memory footprint: memory on these systems range from 8-16KB (on the low end) to 16MB (on the high end). Reduced code size: code often runs out of flash, and total available code size ranges from 64-128KB to 16-32MB. Low processing speed: processor speeds vary from 10-12MHz to 160-200MHz. Low power operation: devices operate in mostly sleeping mode, in order to conserve battery power and maximize power usage. As more and more devices get connected, these interconnected devices perform complex tasks. To perform these tasks, you need low-level operational functionality built into the operating system.

Each of these features is described in detail in its own section of the manual. A multitasking, preemptive operating system is one in which a number of different tasks can be instantiated and assigned a priority, with higher priority tasks running before lower priority tasks. Furthermore, if a lower priority task is running and a higher priority task wants to run, the lower priority task is halted and the higher priority task is allowed to run. In other words, the lower priority task is preempted by the higher priority task. Why use an OS? You may ask yourself \"why do I need a multitasking preemptive OS\"? The answer may indeed be that you do not. Some applications are simple and only require a polling loop. Others are more complex and may require that certain jobs are executed in a timely manner or before other jobs are executed. If you have a simple polling loop, you cannot move on to service a job until the current job is done being serviced. With the Mynewt OS, the application developer need not worry about certain jobs taking too long or not executing in a timely fashion; the OS provides mechanisms to deal with these situations. Another benefit of using an OS is that it helps shield application developers from other application code being written; the developer does not have to worry (or has to worry less) about other application code behaving badly and causing undesirable behavior or preventing their code from executing properly. Other benefits of using an OS (and the Mynewt OS in particular) is that it also provides features that the developer would otherwise need to create on his/her own. Core OS Features Scheduler/context switching Time Tasks Event queues/callouts Semaphores Mutexes Memory pools Heap Mbufs Sanity Callouts Porting OS to other platforms Basic OS Application Creation Creating an application using the Mynewt Core OS is a relatively simple task: once you have installed the basic Newt Tool structure (build structure) for your application and created your BSP (Board Support Package), the developer initializes the OS by calling os_init() , performs application specific initializations, and then starts the os by calling os_start() . The os_init() API performs two basic functions: calls architecture and bsp specific setup and initializes the idle task of the OS. This is required before the OS is started. The OS start API initializes the OS time tick interrupt and starts the highest priority task running (i.e starts the scheduler). Note that os_start() never returns; once called the device is either running in an application task context or in idle task context. Initializing application modules and tasks can get somewhat complicated with RTOS's similar to Mynewt. Care must be taken that the API provided by a task are initialized prior to being called by another (higher priority) task. For example, take a simple application with two tasks (tasks 1 and 2, with task 1 higher priority than task 2). Task 2 provides an API which has a semaphore lock and this semaphore is initialized by task 2 when the task handler for task 2 is called. Task 1 is expected to call this API. Consider the sequence of events when the OS is started. The scheduler starts running and picks the highest priority task (task 1 in this case). The task handler function for task 1 is called and will keep running until it yields execution. Before yielding, code in the task 1 handler function calls the API provided by task 2. The semaphore being accessed in the task 2 API has yet to be initialized since the task 2 handler function has not had a chance to run! This will lead to undesirable behavior and will need to be addressed by the application developer. Note that the Mynewt OS does guard against internal API being called before the OS has started (they will return error) but it does not safeguard application defined objects from access prior to initialization. Example One way to avoid initialization issues like the one described above is to perform task initializations prior to starting the OS. The code example shown below illustrates this concept. The application initializes the OS, calls an application specific \"task initialization\" function, and then starts the OS. The application task initialization function is responsible for initializing all the data objects that each task exposes to the other tasks. The tasks themselves are also initialized at this time (by calling os_task_init() ). In the example, each task works in a ping-pong like fashion: task 1 wakes up, adds a token to semaphore 1 and then waits for a token from semaphore 2. Task 2 waits for a token on semaphore 1 and once it gets it, adds a token to semaphore 2. Notice that the semaphores are initialized by the application specific task initialization functions and not inside the task handler functions. If task 2 (being lower in priority than task 1) had called os_sem_init() for task2_sem inside task2_handler(), task 1 would have called os_sem_pend() using task2_sem before task2_sem was initialized. /* Task 1 handler function */ void task1_handler(void *arg) { while (1) { /* Release semaphore to task 2 */ os_sem_release(&task1_sem); /* Wait for semaphore from task 2 */ os_sem_pend(&task2_sem, OS_TIMEOUT_NEVER); } } /* Task 2 handler function */ void task2_handler(void *arg) { struct os_task *t; while (1) { /* Wait for semaphore from task1 */ os_sem_pend(&task1_sem, OS_TIMEOUT_NEVER); /* Release task2 semaphore */ os_sem_release(&task2_sem); } } /* Initialize task 1 exposed data objects */ void task1_init(void) { /* Initialize task1 semaphore */ os_sem_init(&task1_sem, 0); } /* Initialize task 2 exposed data objects */ void task2_init(void) { /* Initialize task1 semaphore */ os_sem_init(&task2_sem, 0); } /** * init_app_tasks * * Called by main.c after os_init().

Description Callout is a way of setting up an OS timer. When the timer fires, it is delivered as an event to task's event queue. User would initialize their callout structure using os_callout_init() , or os_callout_func_init() and then arm it with os_callout_reset() . If user wants to cancel the timer before it expires, they can either use os_callout_reset() to arm it for later expiry, or stop it altogether by calling os_callout_stop() . There are 2 different options for data structure to use. First is struct os_callout , which is a bare-bones version. You would initialize this with os_callout_init() . Second option is struct os_callout_func . This you can use if you expect to have multiple different types of timers in your task, running concurrently. The structure contains a function pointer, and you would call that function from your task's event processing loop. Time unit when arming the timer is OS ticks. This rate of this ticker depends on the platform this is running on. You should use OS define OS_TICKS_PER_SEC to convert wallclock time to OS ticks. Callout timer fires out just once.

The mbuf is used to hold packet data as it traverses the stack. The mbuf also generally stores header information or other networking stack information that is carried around with the packet. The mbuf and its associated library of functions were developed to make common networking stack operations (like stripping and adding protocol headers) efficient and as copy-free as possible. In its simplest form, an mbuf is a memory block with some space reserved for internal information and a pointer which is used to \"chain\" memory blocks together in order to create a \"packet\". This is a very important aspect of the mbuf: the ability to chain mbufs together to create larger \"packets\" (chains of mbufs). Why use mbufs? The main reason is to conserve memory. Consider a networking protocol that generally sends small packets but occasionally sends large ones. The Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) protocol is one such example. A flat buffer would need to be sized so that the maximum packet size could be contained by the buffer. With the mbuf, a number of mbufs can be chained together so that the occasional large packet can be handled while leaving more packet buffers available to the networking stack for smaller packets. Packet Header mbuf Not all mbufs are created equal. The first mbuf in a chain of mbufs is a special mbuf called a \"packet header mbuf\". The reason that this mbuf is special is that it contains the length of all the data contained by the chain of mbufs (the packet length, in other words). The packet header mbuf may also contain a user defined structure (called a \"user header\") so that networking protocol specific information can be conveyed to various layers of the networking stack. Any mbufs that are part of the packet (i.e. in the mbuf chain but not the first one) are \"normal\" (i.e. non-packet header) mbufs. A normal mbuf does not have any packet header or user packet header structures in them; they only contain the basic mbuf header ( struct os_mbuf ). Figure 1 illustrates these two types of mbufs. Note that the numbers/text in parentheses denote the size of the structures/elements (in bytes) and that MBLEN is the memory block length of the memory pool used by the mbuf pool. Normal mbuf Now let's take a deeper dive into the mbuf structure. Figure 2 illustrates a normal mbuf and breaks out the various fields in the os_mbuf structure. The om_data field is a pointer to where the data starts inside the data buffer. Typically, mbufs that are allocated from the mbuf pool (discussed later) have their om_data pointer set to the start of the data buffer but there are cases where this may not be desirable (added a protocol header to a packet, for example). The om_flags field is a set of flags used internally by the mbuf library. Currently, no flags have been defined. The om_pkthdr_len field is the total length of all packet headers in the mbuf. For normal mbufs this is set to 0 as there is no packet or user packet headers. For packet header mbufs, this would be set to the length of the packet header structure (16) plus the size of the user packet header (if any). Note that it is this field which differentiates packet header mbufs from normal mbufs (i.e. if om_pkthdr_len is zero, this is a normal mbuf; otherwise it is a packet header mbuf). The om_len field contains the amount of user data in the data buffer. When initially allocated, this field is 0 as there is no user data in the mbuf. The omp_pool field is a pointer to the pool from which this mbuf has been allocated. This is used internally by the mbuf library. The omp_next field is a linked list element which is used to chain mbufs. Figure 2 also shows a normal mbuf with actual values in the os_mbuf structure. This mbuf starts at address 0x1000 and is 256 bytes in total length. In this example, the user has copied 33 bytes into the data buffer starting at address 0x1010 (this is where om_data points). Note that the packet header length in this mbuf is 0 as it is not a packet header mbuf. Figure 3 illustrates the packet header mbuf along with some chained mbufs (i.e a \"packet\"). In this example, the user header structure is defined to be 8 bytes. Note that in figure 3 we show a number of different mbufs with varying om_data pointers and lengths since we want to show various examples of valid mbufs. For all the mbufs (both packet header and normal ones) the total length of the memory block is 128 bytes. Mbuf pools Mbufs are collected into \"mbuf pools\" much like memory blocks. The mbuf pool itself contains a pointer to a memory pool. The memory blocks in this memory pool are the actual mbufs; both normal and packet header mbufs. Thus, the memory block (and corresponding memory pool) must be sized correctly. In other words, the memory blocks which make up the memory pool used by the mbuf pool must be at least: sizeof(struct os_mbuf) + sizeof(struct os_mbuf_pkthdr) + sizeof(struct user_defined_header) + desired minimum data buffer length. For example, if the developer wants mbufs to contain at least 64 bytes of user data and they have a user header of 12 bytes, the size of the memory block would be (at least): 64 + 12 + 16 + 8, or 100 bytes. Yes, this is a fair amount of overhead. However, the flexibility provided by the mbuf library usually outweighs overhead concerns. Create mbuf pool Creating an mbuf pool is fairly simple: create a memory pool and then create the mbuf pool using that memory pool. Once the developer has determined the size of the user data needed per mbuf (this is based on the application/networking stack and is outside the scope of this discussion) and the size of the user header (if any), the memory blocks can be sized. In the example shown below, the application requires 64 bytes of user data per mbuf and also allocates a user header (called struct user_hdr). Note that we do not show the user header data structure as there really is no need; all we need to do is to account for it when creating the memory pool. In the example, we use the macro MBUF_PKTHDR_OVERHEAD to denote the amount of packet header overhead per mbuf and MBUF_MEMBLOCK_OVERHEAD to denote the total amount of overhead required per memory block. The macro MBUF_BUF_SIZE is used to denote the amount of payload that the application requires (aligned on a 32-bit boundary in this case). All this leads to the total memory block size required, denoted by the macro MBUF_MEMBLOCK_OVERHEAD . #define MBUF_PKTHDR_OVERHEAD sizeof(struct os_mbuf_pkthdr) + sizeof(struct user_hdr) #define MBUF_MEMBLOCK_OVERHEAD sizeof(struct os_mbuf) + MBUF_PKTHDR_OVERHEAD #define MBUF_NUM_MBUFS (32) #define MBUF_PAYLOAD_SIZE (64) #define MBUF_BUF_SIZE OS_ALIGN(MBUF_PAYLOAD_SIZE, 4) #define MBUF_MEMBLOCK_SIZE (MBUF_BUF_SIZE + MBUF_MEMBLOCK_OVERHEAD) #define MBUF_MEMPOOL_SIZE OS_MEMPOOL_SIZE(MBUF_NUM_MBUFS, MBUF_MEMBLOCK_SIZE) struct os_mbuf_pool g_mbuf_pool ; struct os_mempool g_mbuf_mempool ; os_membuf_t g_mbuf_buffer [ MBUF_MEMPOOL_SIZE ]; void create_mbuf_pool ( void ) { int rc ; rc = os_mempool_init ( &g_mbuf_mempool , MBUF_NUM_MBUFS , MBUF_MEMBLOCK_SIZE , &g_mbuf_buffer [ 0 ], \"mbuf_pool\" ); assert ( rc == 0 ); rc = os_mbuf_pool_init ( &g_mbuf_pool , &g_mbuf_mempool , MBUF_MEMBLOCK_SIZE , MBUF_NUM_MBUFS ); assert ( rc == 0 ); } Using mbufs The following examples illustrate typical mbuf usage. There are two basic mbuf allocation API: os_mbuf_get() and os_mbuf_get_pkthdr() . The first API obtains a normal mbuf whereas the latter obtains a packet header mbuf. Typically, application developers use os_mbuf_get_pkthdr() and rarely, if ever, need to call os_mbuf_get() as the rest of the mbuf API (e.g. os_mbuf_append() , os_mbuf_copyinto() , etc.) typically deal with allocating and chaining mbufs. It is recommended to use the provided API to copy data into/out of mbuf chains and/or manipulate mbufs. In example1 , the developer creates a packet and then sends the packet to a networking interface. The code sample also provides an example of copying data out of an mbuf as well as use of the \"pullup\" api (another very common mbuf api). void mbuf_usage_example1 ( uint8_t *mydata , int mydata_length ) { int rc ; struct os_mbuf *om ; /* get a packet header mbuf */ om = os_mbuf_get_pkthdr ( &g_mbuf_pool , sizeof ( struct user_hdr )); if ( om ) { /* * Copy user data into mbuf. NOTE: if mydata_length is greater than the * mbuf payload size (64 bytes using above example), mbufs are allocated * and chained together to accommodate the total packet length. */ rc = os_mbuf_copyinto ( om , 0 , mydata , len ); if ( rc ) { /* Error! Could not allocate enough mbufs for total packet length */ return - 1 ; } /* Send packet to networking interface */ send_pkt ( om ); } } In example2 we show use of the pullup api as this illustrates some of the typical pitfalls developers encounter when using mbufs. The first pitfall is one of alignment/padding. Depending on the processor and/or compiler, the sizeof() a structure may vary. Thus, the size of my_protocol_header may be different inside the packet data of the mbuf than the size of the structure on the stack or as a global variable, for instance. While some networking protcols may align protocol information on convenient processor boundaries many others try to conserve bytes \"on the air\" (i.e inside the packet data). Typical methods used to deal with this are \"packing\" the structure (i.e. force compiler to not pad) or creating protocol headers that do not require padding. example2 assumes that one of these methods was used when defining the my_protocol_header structure. Another common pitfall occurs around endianness. A network protocol may be little endian or big endian; it all depends on the protocol specification. Processors also have an endianness; this means that the developer has to be careful that the processor endianness and the protocol endianness are handled correctly. In example2 , some common networking functions are used: ntohs() and ntohl() . These are shorthand for \"network order to host order, short\" and \"network order to host order, long\". Basically, these functions convert data of a certain size (i.e. 16 bits, 32 bits, etc) to the endianness of the host. Network byte order is big-endian (most significant byte first), so these functions convert big-endian byte order to host order (thus, the implementation of these functions is host dependent). Note that the BLE networking stack \"on the air\" format is least signigicant byte first (i.e. little endian), so a \"bletoh\" function would have to take little endian format and convert to host format. A long story short: the developer must take care when copying structure data to/from mbufs and flat buffers! A final note: these examples assume the same mbuf struture and definitions used in the first example. void mbuf_usage_example2 ( struct mbuf *rxpkt ) { int rc ; uint8_t packet_data [ 16 ]; struct mbuf *om ; struct my_protocol_header *phdr ; /* Make sure that \"my_protocol_header\" bytes are contiguous in mbuf */ om = os_mbuf_pullup ( &g_mbuf_pool , sizeof ( struct my_protocol_header )); if ( !om ) { /* Not able to pull up data into contiguous area */ return - 1 ; } /* * Get the protocol information from the packet.

The mbuf is used to hold packet data as it traverses the stack. The mbuf also generally stores header information or other networking stack information that is carried around with the packet. The mbuf and its associated library of functions were developed to make common networking stack operations (like stripping and adding protocol headers) efficient and as copy-free as possible. In its simplest form, an mbuf is a memory block with some space reserved for internal information and a pointer which is used to \"chain\" memory blocks together in order to create a \"packet\". This is a very important aspect of the mbuf: the ability to chain mbufs together to create larger \"packets\" (chains of mbufs).","title":"Mbufs"},{"location":"os/core_os/mbuf/mbuf/#why-use-mbufs","text":"The main reason is to conserve memory. Consider a networking protocol that generally sends small packets but occasionally sends large ones. The Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) protocol is one such example. A flat buffer would need to be sized so that the maximum packet size could be contained by the buffer. With the mbuf, a number of mbufs can be chained together so that the occasional large packet can be handled while leaving more packet buffers available to the networking stack for smaller packets.","title":"Why use mbufs?"},{"location":"os/core_os/mbuf/mbuf/#packet-header-mbuf","text":"Not all mbufs are created equal. The first mbuf in a chain of mbufs is a special mbuf called a \"packet header mbuf\". The reason that this mbuf is special is that it contains the length of all the data contained by the chain of mbufs (the packet length, in other words). The packet header mbuf may also contain a user defined structure (called a \"user header\") so that networking protocol specific information can be conveyed to various layers of the networking stack. Any mbufs that are part of the packet (i.e. in the mbuf chain but not the first one) are \"normal\" (i.e. non-packet header) mbufs. A normal mbuf does not have any packet header or user packet header structures in them; they only contain the basic mbuf header ( struct os_mbuf ). Figure 1 illustrates these two types of mbufs. Note that the numbers/text in parentheses denote the size of the structures/elements (in bytes) and that MBLEN is the memory block length of the memory pool used by the mbuf pool.","title":"Packet Header mbuf"},{"location":"os/core_os/mbuf/mbuf/#normal-mbuf","text":"Now let's take a deeper dive into the mbuf structure. Figure 2 illustrates a normal mbuf and breaks out the various fields in the os_mbuf structure. The om_data field is a pointer to where the data starts inside the data buffer. Typically, mbufs that are allocated from the mbuf pool (discussed later) have their om_data pointer set to the start of the data buffer but there are cases where this may not be desirable (added a protocol header to a packet, for example). The om_flags field is a set of flags used internally by the mbuf library. Currently, no flags have been defined. The om_pkthdr_len field is the total length of all packet headers in the mbuf. For normal mbufs this is set to 0 as there is no packet or user packet headers. For packet header mbufs, this would be set to the length of the packet header structure (16) plus the size of the user packet header (if any). Note that it is this field which differentiates packet header mbufs from normal mbufs (i.e. if om_pkthdr_len is zero, this is a normal mbuf; otherwise it is a packet header mbuf). The om_len field contains the amount of user data in the data buffer. When initially allocated, this field is 0 as there is no user data in the mbuf. The omp_pool field is a pointer to the pool from which this mbuf has been allocated. This is used internally by the mbuf library. The omp_next field is a linked list element which is used to chain mbufs. Figure 2 also shows a normal mbuf with actual values in the os_mbuf structure. This mbuf starts at address 0x1000 and is 256 bytes in total length. In this example, the user has copied 33 bytes into the data buffer starting at address 0x1010 (this is where om_data points). Note that the packet header length in this mbuf is 0 as it is not a packet header mbuf. Figure 3 illustrates the packet header mbuf along with some chained mbufs (i.e a \"packet\"). In this example, the user header structure is defined to be 8 bytes. Note that in figure 3 we show a number of different mbufs with varying om_data pointers and lengths since we want to show various examples of valid mbufs. For all the mbufs (both packet header and normal ones) the total length of the memory block is 128 bytes.","title":"Normal mbuf"},{"location":"os/core_os/mbuf/mbuf/#mbuf-pools","text":"Mbufs are collected into \"mbuf pools\" much like memory blocks. The mbuf pool itself contains a pointer to a memory pool. The memory blocks in this memory pool are the actual mbufs; both normal and packet header mbufs. Thus, the memory block (and corresponding memory pool) must be sized correctly. In other words, the memory blocks which make up the memory pool used by the mbuf pool must be at least: sizeof(struct os_mbuf) + sizeof(struct os_mbuf_pkthdr) + sizeof(struct user_defined_header) + desired minimum data buffer length. For example, if the developer wants mbufs to contain at least 64 bytes of user data and they have a user header of 12 bytes, the size of the memory block would be (at least): 64 + 12 + 16 + 8, or 100 bytes. Yes, this is a fair amount of overhead. However, the flexibility provided by the mbuf library usually outweighs overhead concerns.","title":"Mbuf pools"},{"location":"os/core_os/mbuf/mbuf/#create-mbuf-pool","text":"Creating an mbuf pool is fairly simple: create a memory pool and then create the mbuf pool using that memory pool. Once the developer has determined the size of the user data needed per mbuf (this is based on the application/networking stack and is outside the scope of this discussion) and the size of the user header (if any), the memory blocks can be sized. In the example shown below, the application requires 64 bytes of user data per mbuf and also allocates a user header (called struct user_hdr). Note that we do not show the user header data structure as there really is no need; all we need to do is to account for it when creating the memory pool. In the example, we use the macro MBUF_PKTHDR_OVERHEAD to denote the amount of packet header overhead per mbuf and MBUF_MEMBLOCK_OVERHEAD to denote the total amount of overhead required per memory block. The macro MBUF_BUF_SIZE is used to denote the amount of payload that the application requires (aligned on a 32-bit boundary in this case).

There are two basic mbuf allocation API: os_mbuf_get() and os_mbuf_get_pkthdr() . The first API obtains a normal mbuf whereas the latter obtains a packet header mbuf. Typically, application developers use os_mbuf_get_pkthdr() and rarely, if ever, need to call os_mbuf_get() as the rest of the mbuf API (e.g. os_mbuf_append() , os_mbuf_copyinto() , etc.) typically deal with allocating and chaining mbufs. It is recommended to use the provided API to copy data into/out of mbuf chains and/or manipulate mbufs. In example1 , the developer creates a packet and then sends the packet to a networking interface. The code sample also provides an example of copying data out of an mbuf as well as use of the \"pullup\" api (another very common mbuf api). void mbuf_usage_example1 ( uint8_t *mydata , int mydata_length ) { int rc ; struct os_mbuf *om ; /* get a packet header mbuf */ om = os_mbuf_get_pkthdr ( &g_mbuf_pool , sizeof ( struct user_hdr )); if ( om ) { /* * Copy user data into mbuf. NOTE: if mydata_length is greater than the * mbuf payload size (64 bytes using above example), mbufs are allocated * and chained together to accommodate the total packet length. */ rc = os_mbuf_copyinto ( om , 0 , mydata , len ); if ( rc ) { /* Error! Could not allocate enough mbufs for total packet length */ return - 1 ; } /* Send packet to networking interface */ send_pkt ( om ); } } In example2 we show use of the pullup api as this illustrates some of the typical pitfalls developers encounter when using mbufs. The first pitfall is one of alignment/padding. Depending on the processor and/or compiler, the sizeof() a structure may vary. Thus, the size of my_protocol_header may be different inside the packet data of the mbuf than the size of the structure on the stack or as a global variable, for instance. While some networking protcols may align protocol information on convenient processor boundaries many others try to conserve bytes \"on the air\" (i.e inside the packet data). Typical methods used to deal with this are \"packing\" the structure (i.e. force compiler to not pad) or creating protocol headers that do not require padding. example2 assumes that one of these methods was used when defining the my_protocol_header structure. Another common pitfall occurs around endianness. A network protocol may be little endian or big endian; it all depends on the protocol specification. Processors also have an endianness; this means that the developer has to be careful that the processor endianness and the protocol endianness are handled correctly. In example2 , some common networking functions are used: ntohs() and ntohl() . These are shorthand for \"network order to host order, short\" and \"network order to host order, long\". Basically, these functions convert data of a certain size (i.e. 16 bits, 32 bits, etc) to the endianness of the host. Network byte order is big-endian (most significant byte first), so these functions convert big-endian byte order to host order (thus, the implementation of these functions is host dependent). Note that the BLE networking stack \"on the air\" format is least signigicant byte first (i.e. little endian), so a \"bletoh\" function would have to take little endian format and convert to host format. A long story short: the developer must take care when copying structure data to/from mbufs and flat buffers! A final note: these examples assume the same mbuf struture and definitions used in the first example. void mbuf_usage_example2 ( struct mbuf *rxpkt ) { int rc ; uint8_t packet_data [ 16 ]; struct mbuf *om ; struct my_protocol_header *phdr ; /* Make sure that \"my_protocol_header\" bytes are contiguous in mbuf */ om = os_mbuf_pullup ( &g_mbuf_pool , sizeof ( struct my_protocol_header )); if ( !om ) { /* Not able to pull up data into contiguous area */ return - 1 ; } /* * Get the protocol information from the packet.

Generally, memory pools are used when the developer wants to allocate a certain amount of memory to a given feature. Unlike the heap, where a code module is at the mercy of other code modules to insure there is sufficient memory, memory pools can insure sufficient memory allocation. Description In order to create a memory pool the developer needs to do a few things. The first task is to define the memory pool itself. This is a data structure which contains information about the pool itself (i.e. number of blocks, size of the blocks, etc). struct os_mempool my_pool ; The next order of business is to allocate the memory used by the memory pool. This memory can either be statically allocated (i.e. a global variable) or dynamically allocated (i.e. from the heap).

The alignment size definition is named OS_ALIGNMENT and can be found in os_arch.h as it is architecture specific. The memory block alignment is usually for efficiency but may be due to other reasons. Generally, blocks are aligned on 32-bit boundaries. Note that memory blocks must also be of sufficient size to hold a list pointer as this is needed to chain memory blocks on the free list.

The basic idea behind msys is the following. The developer can create different size mbuf pools and register them with msys. The application then allocates mbufs using the msys API (as opposed to the mbuf API). The msys code will choose the mbuf pool with the smallest mbufs that can accommodate the requested size. Let us walk through an example where the user registers three mbuf pools with msys: one with 32 byte mbufs, one with 256 and one with 2048. If the user requests an mbuf with 10 bytes, the 32-byte mbuf pool is used. If the request is for 33 bytes the 256 byte mbuf pool is used. If an mbuf data size is requested that is larger than any of the pools (say, 4000 bytes) the largest pool is used. While this behaviour may not be optimal in all cases that is the currently implemented behaviour. All this means is that the user is not guaranteed that a single mbuf can hold the requested data. The msys code will not allocate an mbuf from a larger pool if the chosen mbuf pool is empty. Similarly, the msys code will not chain together a number of smaller mbufs to accommodate the requested size. While this behaviour may change in future implementations the current code will simply return NULL. Using the above example, say the user requests 250 bytes. The msys code chooses the appropriate pool (i.e. the 256 byte mbuf pool) and attempts to allocate an mbuf from that pool. If that pool is empty, NULL is returned even though the 32 and 2048 byte pools are not empty. Note that no added descriptions on how to use the msys API are presented here (other than in the API descriptions themselves) as the msys API is used in exactly the same manner as the mbuf API.

A mutex provides priority inheritance in order to prevent priority inversion . Priority inversion occurs when a higher priority task is waiting on a resource owned by a lower priority task. Using a mutex, the lower priority task will inherit the highest priority of any task waiting on the mutex. Description The first order of business when using a mutex is to declare the mutex globally. The mutex needs to be initialized before it is used (see the examples). It is generally a good idea to initialize the mutex before tasks start running in order to avoid a task possibly using the mutex before it is initialized. When a task wants exclusive access to a shared resource it needs to obtain the mutex by calling os_mutex_pend . If the mutex is currently owned by a different task (a lower priority task), the requesting task will be put to sleep and the owners priority will be elevated to the priority of the requesting task. Note that multiple tasks can request ownership and the current owner is elevated to the highest priority of any task waitin on the mutex. When the task is done using the shared resource, it needs to release the mutex by called os_mutex_release . There needs to be one release per call to pend. Note that nested calls to os_mutex_pend are allowed but there needs to be one release per pend. The following example will illustrate how priority inheritance works. In this example, the task number is the same as its priority. Remember that the lower the number, the higher the priority (i.e. priority 0 is higher priority than priority 1). Suppose that task 5 gets ownership of a mutex but is preempted by task 4. Task 4 attempts to gain ownership of the mutex but cannot as it is owned by task 5. Task 4 is put to sleep and task 5 is temporarily raised to priority 4. Before task 5 can release the mutex, task 3 runs and attempts to acquire the mutex. At this point, both task 3 and task 4 are waiting on the mutex (sleeping). Task 5 now runs at priority 3 (the highest priority of all the tasks waiting on the mutex). When task 5 finally releases the mutex it will be preempted as two higher priority tasks are waiting for it. Note that when multiple tasks are waiting on a mutex owned by another task, once the mutex is released the highest priority task waiting on the mutex is run.

If another similar BSP exists it is recommended to copy that BSP as a starting point. For example, if another BSP exists using the same MCU, start with a copy of that BSP. Either way, this document describes the steps necessary to create a new BSP from scratch. Keep your Reference Documents handy To build a proper BSP, you will typically need the following: The datasheet for the MCU you have chosen The schematic of your board The information on the CPU core within your MCU if it is not included in your MCU documentation This Mynewt documentation Name your BSP Select a name for your BSP. For the remainder of this document, we'll assume the bsp is named myboard . In general its best to select a name that describes the board/system you are creating. Create a BSP directory Create a directory hw/bsp/myboard using the name chosen above. Within this BSP directory, create the following subdirectories: Select a name for your BSP. For the remainder of this document, well assume the bsp is named myboard . In general its best to select a name that describes the board/system you are creating. include include/bsp src Create a Target using Mynewt Create a newt target for your test project for the BSP. To learn how to create a target, see this howto Tutorial . Once you are familiar with creating targets, move on below to create a target to use to test your BSP. It is recommended that you use a simple project like blinky to minimize time to get a working Mynewt system. For this document, we will assume the target is called myboard_blinky and uses project blinky . Set the bsp of the project to /hw/bsp/myboard . While creating your target, you will need to specify your arch and compiler . If your platform requires an architecture or compiler that are not defined in Mynewt, you will need to add them first. To add a CPU architecture see CPU Porting . When you are complete, your target may look similar to this. $newt target show myboard_blinky arch=cortex_m0 bsp=hw/bsp/myboard compiler=arm-none-eabi-m0 compiler_def=debug name=myboard_blinky project=blinky Create Required Files For Compilation Create the following files within the BSP directory tree.

The linker script is a key component of the BSP and specifies where each section of code and data are stored within your CPU which can vary with the BSP depending on your chosen memory layout. For a tutorial on writing linker scripts, see Create or Copy Linker Script(s) . The package file typically contains: pkg . linkerscript . bootloader . OVERWRITE : \"myboard_boot.ld\" pkg . downloadscript : \"myboard_download.sh\" pkg . debugscript : \"myboard_debug.sh\" pkg . deps : - hw/mcu/mymcu/variant where mymcu/variant should be replaced with the specific MCU and variant used in your design.

If your MCU is not supported by Mynewt, see MCU Porting for details on how to create an MCU in Mynewt. The package file may also contain: pkg . cflags : -D__MY_SPECIAL_BSP_OPTIONS_ pkg . deps : - libs/cmsis-core Attribute Description pkg.cflags Any specific compiler flags for your bsp pkg.deps Any other libraries that may be required. Some architectures (like ARM) have special libraries to make BSP creation easier. Create or Copy Linker Script It's probably best to start with a linker script from another BSP using the same MCU. If this is not available, consult your MCU documentation and library samples to find a linker script to start with. Typically, a linker script has to specify the following sections for code: .text -- the location and alignment of the memory section to store your code .data -- the location and alignment of the memory section to store initialized data .bss -- the location and alignment of the memory section to store uninitialized data .heap -- the location and alignment of the memory section to provide system memory The linker script should specify the location and size of the different memory regions in your BSP and map the code sections described above into these regions. The linker script should also include an ENTRY point. This is used by the debugger to know where to start the program counter when the target is debugged. There may be additional requirements from the MCU or OS that you may find easiest to place in the linker script. Some specific variables that the OS and MCU depends on are : Variable Description __bss_start__ a variable located at the start of the BSS section __bss_end__ a variable located at the end of the BSS section __isr_vector Some CPUs map their interrupt vectors. They may need to be specified in the linker _user_heap_start the start of the heap for unallocated memory _user_heap_end the end of the heap for unallocated memory Create an alternate linker script for the bootloader since it is typically linked to use different addresses to boot the main image. Add Functions and Defines At this point, it will be possible to run the newt tool to build your target. You may run into complaints from the linker script that a few Mynewt specific functions are missing. We will describe these below. Function Description os_bsp_init() code to initialize the bsp os_bsp_systick_init() code to setup the system tick for the OS There are also several libc definitions that can be stubbed in your first BSP. Examples are _write , _read , etc. that can be found in libc_stubs.c . But you must implement the following function to provide memory to the OS and system. Function Description _sbrk Returns memory from heap (used by malloc) Implement _sbrk() sbrk() is required by libc to get memory from the heap for things like malloc. Although not strongly BSP dependent, this is currently in the BSP to allow flexibility in providing system memory. See other BSPs for providing sbrk functionality. Implement os_bsp_init() os_bsp_init should initialize anything required by the OS by the BSP. Typically this is a very small set. NOTE: Currently we are making calls to _sbrk() and close(0) from os_bsp_init to get around a linker issue where some of libc is not getting included. Please include this in your os_bsp_init . /* * XXX these references are here to keep the functions in for libc to find. */ _sbrk ( 0 ); _close ( 0 ); Other Unresolved Defines or Functions There may be other unresolved defines or functions that are required by the specific MCU within your BSP. Below lists some sample defines. Undefined Variable Description CONSOLE_UART_PORT Which communications port on your target runs the console LED_BLINK_PIN which pin on your target runs the blinky LED The set of missing functionality depends upon the libraries and dependencies you have included in the project. That's why its best to keep your first project pretty simple then add incrementally. For example, if you include Newtron file system, you will need to define a file system map for your BSP. Missing functionality may take the form of #define items required to compile, or they may take the form of missing functions. cmsis_nvic.h If you are using an ARM cortex architecture, you need to define the number of interrupts supported by your system. If you are not using ARM Cortex architecture this may not be required (but something else might be). Add Debug Script The debug script in the bsp directory allows the newt tool to automatically connect to the debugger, and create a debug session with the target. This requires knowledge of your target debug interface. Most of the Mynewt BSP targets use openocd to perform debugging. This script typically creates an openocd connection to the target and then connects a gdb instance to this openocd connection. There are several examples in existing BSPs to follow. The script must take a single argument which is the name of the image file minus the '.elf' suffix. The BSP is complete without this file, but newt will be unable to establish a debug session without it. Add Download Script Similar to the debug script, the download script is a hook for newt to download the image to the target system. The download script also typically uses openocd interface to erase flash, and progam the code into the device. NOTE: The download script needs to command openocd to program the image into the appropriate location, which is typically called FLASH_OFFSET in these scripts. This location has to match the linker script location of the image link address. For example, if your linker links the code to be run at 0xC000 your download script should download the image to the same address in the correct flash.

Description The Mynewt OS is a complete multi-tasking environment with scheduler, time control, buffer management, and synchronization objects. it also includes libraries and services like console, command shell, image manager, bootloader, and file systems etc. Thee majority of this software is platform independent and requires no intervention to run on your platform, but some of the components require support from the underlying platform. The platform dependency of these components can fall into several categories: CPU Core Dependencies -- Specific code or configuration to operate the CPU core within your target platform MCU Dependencies -- Specific code or configuration to operate the MCU or SoC within your target platform BSP Dependencies -- Specific code or configuration to accommodate the specific layout and functionality of your target platform BSP Dependency With all of the functionality provided by the core, MCU, and MCU HAL (Hardware Abstraction Layer), there are still some things that must be specified for your particular system. This is provided in Mynewt to allow you the flexibility to design for the exact functionality, peripherals and features that you require in your product. In Mynewt, these settings/components are included in a Board Support Package (BSP). The BSP contains the information specific to running Mynewt on a target platform or hardware board. Mynewt supports some common open source hardware as well as the development boards for some common MCUs. These development systems might be enough for you to get your prototype up and running, but when building a product you are likely going to have your own board which is slightly different from those already supported by Mynewt. For example, you might decide on your system that 16 Kilobytes of flash space in one flash device is reserved for a flash file system. Or on your system you may decide that GPIO pin 5 of the MCU is connected to the system LED. Or you may decide that the OS Tick (the underlying time source for the OS) should run slower than the defaults to conserve battery power. These types of behaviors are specified in the BSP. The information provided in the BSP (what you need to specify to get a complete executable) can vary depending on the MCU and its underlying core architecture. For example, some MCUs have dedicated pins for UART, SPI etc, so there is no configuration required in the BSP when using these peripherals. However some MCUs have a pin multiplexor that allows the UART to be mapped to several different pins. For these MCUs, the BSP must specify if and where the UART pins should appear to match the hardware layout of your system. If your BSP is already supported my Mynewt, there is no additional BSP work involved in porting to your platform. You need only to set the bsp attribute in your Mynewt target using the newt command tool .

In a typical system design, there are multiple stages of watchdog: Internal Watchdog External Watchdog Sanity Watchdog The Internal Watchdog is typically an MCU watchdog, which is tickled in the core of the OS. The internal watchdog is tickled frequently, and is meant to be an indicator the OS is running. The External Watchdog is a watchdog that's typically run slower. The purpose of an external watchdog is to provide the system with a hard reset when it has lost its mind. The Sanity Watchdog is the least frequently run watchdog, and is meant as an application watchdog. This document is about the operation of the Mynewt Sanity Watchdog. Description Initializing the Sanity Task The Sanity Watchdog is a task in the Mynewt OS, which when enabled, runs every sanity_seconds . In order to enable the Sanity Watchdog task, call the os_sanity_task_init() function. int os_sanity_task_init ( int sanity_seconds ); By default, every operating system task provides the frequency it will check in with the sanity task, with the sanity_itvl parameter in the os_task_init() function: int os_task_init ( struct os_task *t , char *name , os_task_func_t func , void *arg , uint8_t prio , os_time_t sanity_itvl , os_stack_t *bottom , uint16_t stack_size ); sanity_itvl is the time in OS time ticks that the task being created must register in with the sanity task. Checking in with Sanity Task The task must then register in with the sanity task every sanity_itvl seconds. In order to do that, the task should call the os_sanity_task_checkin function, which will reset the sanity check associated with this task. Here is an example of a task that uses a callout to checkin with the sanity task every 50 seconds: #define TASK1_SANITY_CHECKIN_ITVL (50 * OS_TICKS_PER_SEC) struct os_eventq task1_evq ; static void task1 ( void *arg ) { struct os_task *t ; struct os_event *ev ; struct os_callout c ; /* Get current OS task */ t = os_sched_get_current_task (); /* Initialize the event queue. */ os_eventq_init ( &task1_evq ); /* Initialize the callout */ os_callout_init ( &c , &task1_evq , NULL ); /* reset the callout to checkin with the sanity task * in 50 seconds to kick off timing. */ os_callout_reset ( &c , TASK1_SANITY_CHECKIN_ITVL ); while ( 1 ) { ev = os_eventq_get ( &task1_evq ); /* The sanity timer has reset */ if ( ev->ev_arg == &c ) { os_sanity_task_checkin ( t ); } else { /* not expecting any other events */ assert ( 0 ); } } /* Should never reach */ assert ( 0 ); } Registering a Custom Sanity Check If a particular task wants to further hook into the sanity framework to perform other checks during the sanity task's operation, it can do so by registering a struct os_sanity_check using the os_sanity_check_register function. static int mymodule_perform_sanity_check ( struct os_sanity_check *sc , void *arg ) { /* Perform your checking here. In this case, we check if there * are available buffers in mymodule, and return 0 (all good) * if true, and -1 (error) if not. */ if ( mymodule_has_buffers ()) { return ( 0 ); } else { return ( - 1 ); } } static int mymodule_register_sanity_check ( void ) { struct os_sanity_check sc ; os_sanity_check_init ( &sc ); /* Only assert() if mymodule_perform_sanity_check() fails 50 * times.

In the OS_SANITY_CHECK_SETFUNC macro, the sanity checkin interval is specified as 50 * SANITY_TASK_INTERVAL (which is the interval at which the sanity task runs.) This means that the mymodule_perform_sanity_check() function needs to fail 50 times consecutively before the sanity task will crash the system. TIP: When checking things like memory buffers, which can be temporarily be exhausted, it's a good idea to have the sanity check fail multiple consecutive times before crashing the system. This will avoid crashing for temporary failures.

Semaphores like the ones used by the myNewt OS are called \"counting\" semaphores as they are allowed to have more than one token (explained below). Description A semaphore is a fairly simple construct consisting of a queue for waiting tasks and the number of tokens currently owned by the semaphore. A semaphore can be obtained as long as there are tokens in the semaphore. Any task can add tokens to the semaphore and any task can request the semaphore, thereby removing tokens. When creating the semaphore, the initial number of tokens can be set as well. When used for exclusive access to a shared resource the semaphore only needs a single token. In this case, a single task \"creates\" the semaphore by calling os_sem_init with a value of one (1) for the token. When a task desires exclusive access to the shared resource it requests the semaphore by calling os_sem_pend . If there is a token the requesting task will acquire the semaphore and continue operation. If no tokens are available the task will be put to sleep until there is a token. A common \"problem\" with using a semaphore for exclusive access is called priority inversion . Consider the following scenario: a high and low priority task both share a resource which is locked using a semaphore. If the low priority task obtains the semaphore and then the high priority task requests the semaphore, the high priority task is now blocked until the low priority task releases the semaphore. Now suppose that there are tasks between the low priority task and the high priority task that want to run. These tasks will preempt the low priority task which owns the semaphore. Thus, the high priority task is blocked waiting for the low priority task to finish using the semaphore but the low priority task cannot run since other tasks are running. Thus, the high priority tasks is \"inverted\" in priority; in effect running at a much lower priority as normally it would preempt the other (lower priority) tasks. If this is an issue a mutex should be used instead of a semaphore. Semaphores can also be used for task synchronization. A simple example of this would be the following. A task creates a semaphore and initializes it with no tokens. The task then waits on the semaphore, and since there are no tokens, the task is put to sleep. When other tasks want to wake up the sleeping task they simply add a token by calling os_sem_release . This will cause the sleeping task to wake up (instantly if no other higher priority tasks want to run). The other common use of a counting semaphore is in what is commonly called a \"producer/consumer\" relationship. The producer adds tokens (by calling os_sem_release ) and the consumer consumes them by calling os_sem_pend . In this relationship, the producer has work for the consumer to do. Each token added to the semaphore will cause the consumer to do whatever work is required. A simple example could be the following: every time a button is pressed there is some work to do (ring a bell). Each button press causes the producer to add a token. Each token consumed rings the bell. There will exactly the same number of bell rings as there are button presses. In other words, each call to os_sem_pend subtracts exactly one token and each call to os_sem_release adds exactly one token.

A task creates a semaphore and initializes it with no tokens. The task then waits on the semaphore, and since there are no tokens, the task is put to sleep. When other tasks want to wake up the sleeping task they simply add a token by calling os_sem_release . This will cause the sleeping task to wake up (instantly if no other higher priority tasks want to run). The other common use of a counting semaphore is in what is commonly called a \"producer/consumer\" relationship. The producer adds tokens (by calling os_sem_release ) and the consumer consumes them by calling os_sem_pend . In this relationship, the producer has work for the consumer to do. Each token added to the semaphore will cause the consumer to do whatever work is required. A simple example could be the following: every time a button is pressed there is some work to do (ring a bell). Each button press causes the producer to add a token. Each token consumed rings the bell. There will exactly the same number of bell rings as there are button presses. In other words, each call to os_sem_pend subtracts exactly one token and each call to os_sem_release adds exactly one token.","title":"Description"},{"location":"os/core_os/semaphore/semaphore/#data-structures","text":"struct os_sem { SLIST_HEAD (, os_task ) sem_head ; /* chain of waiting tasks */ uint16_t _pad ; uint16_t sem_tokens ; /* # of tokens */ }; Element Description sem_head Queue head for list of tasks waiting on semaphore _pad Padding for alignment sem_tokens Current number of tokens","title":"Data structures"},{"location":"os/core_os/semaphore/semaphore/#list-of-functions","text":"The functions available in semaphore are: Function Description os_sem_init Initialize a semaphore with a given number of tokens. os_sem_pend Wait for a semaphore for a given amount of time. os_sem_release Release a semaphore that you are holding.

A task consists of two basic elements: a task stack and a task function. The task function is basically a forever loop, waiting for some \"event\" to wake it up. There are two methods used to signal a task that it has work to do: event queues and semaphores (see the appropriate manual sections for descriptions of these features). The Mynewt OS is a multi-tasking, preemptive OS. Every task is assigned a task priority (from 0 to 255), with 0 being the highest priority task. If a higher priority task than the current task wants to run, the scheduler preempts the currently running task and switches context to the higher priority task. This is just a fancy way of saying that the processor stack pointer now points to the stack of the higher priority task and the task resumes execution where it left off. Tasks run to completion unless they are preempted by a higher priority task. The developer must insure that tasks eventually \"sleep\"; otherwise lower priority tasks will never get a chance to run (actually, any task lower in priority than the task that never sleeps). A task will be put to sleep in the following cases: it puts itself to sleep using os_time_delay() , it waits on an event queue which is empty or attempts to obtain a mutex or a semaphore that is currently owned by another task. Note that other sections of the manual describe these OS features in more detail. Description In order to create a task two data structures need to be defined: the task object (struct os_task) and its associated stack. Determining the stack size can be a bit tricky; generally developers should not declare large local variables on the stack so that task stacks can be of limited size. However, all applications are different and the developer must choose the stack size accordingly. NOTE: be careful when declaring your stack! The stack is in units of os_stack_t sized elements (generally 32-bits). Looking at the example given below and assuming os_stack_t is defined to be a 32-bit unsigned value, \"my_task_stack\" will use 256 bytes. A task must also have an associated \"task function\". This is the function that will be called when the task is first run. This task function should never return! In order to inform the Mynewt OS of the new task and to have it added to the scheduler, the os_task_init() function is called. Once os_task_init() is called, the task is made ready to run and is added to the active task list. Note that a task can be initialized (started) before or after the os has started (i.e. before os_start() is called) but must be initialized after the os has been initialized (i.e. 'os_init' has been called). In most of the examples and current Mynewt projects, the os is initialized, tasks are initialized, and the the os is started. Once the os has started, the highest priority task will be the first task set to run. Information about a task can be obtained using the os_task_info_get_next() API. Developers can walk the list of tasks to obtain information on all created tasks. This information is of type os_task_info and is described below.

The Mynewt OS also provides APIs for setting and retrieving the wallclock time (also known as local time or time-of-day in other operating systems).

Wallclock time is represented using the struct os_timeval and struct os_timezone tuple. struct os_timeval represents the number of seconds elapsed since 00:00:00 Jan 1, 1970 UTC. struct os_timeval { int64_t tv_sec; / seconds since Jan 1 1970 UTC / int32_t tv_usec; / fractional seconds / }; struct os_timeval tv = { 1457400000, 0 }; / 01:20:00 Mar 8 2016 UTC / struct os_timezone is used to specify the offset of local time from UTC and whether daylight savings is in effect. Note that tz_minuteswest is a positive number if the local time is behind UTC and a negative number if the local time is ahead of UTC. struct os_timezone { int16_t tz_minuteswest; int16_t tz_dsttime; }; / Pacific Standard Time is 08:00 hours west of UTC / struct os_timezone PST = { 480, 0 }; struct os_timezone PDT = { 480, 1 }; / Indian Standard Time is 05:30 hours east of UTC / struct os_timezone IST = { -330, 0 }; List of Functions The functions available in time are: Function Description os_time_delay Put the current task to sleep for the given number of ticks. os_time_get Get the current value of OS time. os_time_tick Increments the OS time tick for the system. os_settimeofday Set the current time of day to the given time structs. os_gettimeofday Populate the given timeval and timezone structs with current time data. List of Macros Several macros help with the evalution of times with respect to each other. OS_TIME_TICK_LT(t1,t2) -- evaluates to true if t1 is before t2 in time. OS_TIME_TICK_GT(t1,t2) -- evaluates to true if t1 is after t2 in time OS_TIME_TICK_GEQ(t1,t2) -- evaluates to true if t1 is on or after t2 in time. NOTE: For all of these macros the calculations are done modulo 'os_time_t'. Ensure that comparison of OS time always uses the macros above (to compensate for the possible wrap of OS time). The following macros help adding or subtracting time when represented as struct os_timeval . All parameters to the following macros are pointers to struct os_timeval . os_timeradd(tvp, uvp, vvp) -- Add uvp to tvp and store result in vvp . os_timersub(tvp, uvp, vvp) -- Subtract uvp from tvp and store result in vvp . Special Notes Its important to understand how quickly the time wraps especially when doing time comparison using the macros above (or by any other means). For example, if a tick is 1 millisecond and os_time_t is 32-bits the OS time will wrap back to zero in about 49.7 days or stated another way, the OS time epoch is 49.7 days. If two times are more than 1/2 the OS time epoch apart, any time comparison will be incorrect.

The newt command line tool and the entire build toolchain is available in a single docker container. The container is all that's needed to run your Mynewt based application in the simulator. Enabling USB2 with your docker installation will allow you to load your application on a supported device. Docker is the only supported option if you are working on a Windows machine. If you are using Mac OS X or Linux, you have the choice of installing a Docker container of tools and toolchains or installing them natively. This chapter describes how to set up the Docker image for all three platforms. Install Docker Install docker for your platform. Mac OS X / Windows / Linux Mac and Windows Mac and Windows require Docker Toolbox to interact with USB devices. Docker for Mac and Docker for Windows do not support USB. Docker Toolbox uses VirtualBox and allows you to map USB devices into docker containers as described below. Make sure to double click the Docker Quickstart Terminal application if you're on Mac or Windows. Linux The docker daemon listens on a Unix domain socket on Linux. That socket is owned by root, which means by default you must be root to start a container. Make sure to follow the optional step of adding yourself to the docker group so you can start the newt container as yourself. Use the newt wrapper script Use the newt wrapper script to invoke newt. Create the following file, name it newt , make it executable, and put it in your path. This will allow you to run newt as if it was natively installed. You can now follow the normal tutorials using the newt wrapper script. #!/bin/bash if [ \" $1 \" = \"debug\" ] || [ \" $1 \" = \"run\" ] then ti= \"-ti\" fi docker run -e NEWT_USER= $( id -u ) -e NEWT_GROUP= $( id -g ) -e NEWT_HOST= $( uname ) $ti --rm --device = /dev/bus/usb --privileged -v $(pwd) :/workspace -w /workspace mynewt/newt:latest /newt \" $@ \" Note 1: Remember to point to the correct subdirectory level when invoking newt .

Enable USB2 Support for Mac or Windows If you plan on loading your application on an actual device, do the steps below. Install VirtualBox extension pack Docker uses a VirtualBox Linux VM to run containers. A free VirtualBox extension pack is required to enable USB2 support. Download the VirtualBox 5.0.16 Oracle VM VirtualBox Extension Pack and double click to install Enable USB2 and select your device The \"default\" VM created by docker-machine must first be stopped before you can enable USB2. You have two options: Run the command docker-machine stop default in the terminal window or Use the VirtualBox UI. Right click on default -> Close -> Power Off Enable USB2 using the VirtualBox UI. Select the \"default\" VM->Settings->Ports->USB2 to enable USB2. Add your device to the USB Device Filters to make the device visible in the docker container. See the image below. Restart the \"default\" VM. You have two options: Run docker-machine start default in the terminal window or Use the VirtualBox UI. Make sure the \"default\" machine is highlighted. Click the green \"Start\" button. Select \"Headless Start\". Note 3 : When working with actual hardware, remember that each board has an ID. If you swap boards and do not refresh the USB Device Filter on the VirtualBox UI, the ID might be stale and the Docker instance may not be able to see the board correctly. For example, you may see an error message like Error: unable to find CMSIS-DAP device when you try to load or run an image on the board. In that case, you need to click on the USB link in VirtualBox UI, remove the existing USB Device Filter (e.g. \"Atmel Corp.

Project The project is the base directory of your embedded software tree. It is a workspace that contains a logical collection of source code, for one or more of your applications. A project consists of the following items: Project Definition: defines project level dependencies, and parameters (located in project.yml ) Packages Packages are described in detail in the section below. Here is an example project definition file from the default Apache Mynewt project: $ more project.yml <snip> project.name: \"my_project\" project.repositories: - apache-mynewt-core # Use github's distribution mechanism for core ASF libraries. # This provides mirroring automatically for us. # repository.apache-mynewt-core: type: github vers: 0-latest user: apache repo: incubator-mynewt-core $ A couple of things to note in the project definition: project.repositories : Defines the remote repositories that this project relies upon. repository.apache-mynewt-core : Defines the repository information for the apache-mynewt-core repository. Repositories are versioned collections of packages. Projects can rely on remote repositories for functionality, and the newt tool will resolve those remote repositories, and download the correct version into your local source tree. Newly fetched repositories are put in the repos directory of your project, and can be referenced throughout the system by using the @ specifier. By default, the @apache-mynewt-core repository is included in every project. Apache Mynewt Core contains all the base functionality of the Apache Mynewt Operating System, including the Real Time Kernel, Bluetooth Networking Stack, Flash File System, Console, Shell and Bootloader. NOTE: Any project can be converted into a repository by providing it with a repository.yml file and putting it up onto Github. More information about repositories can be found in the Newt documentation. Package A package is a collection items that form a fundamental unit in the Mynewt Operating System. Packages can be: Applications Libraries Compiler definitions Targets A package is identified by having a pkg.yml file in it's base directory. Here is a sample pkg.yml file for the blinky applicaton: $ more pkg.yml <snip> pkg.name: apps/blinky pkg.type: app pkg.description: Basic example application which blinks an LED. pkg.author: \"Apache Mynewt <dev@mynewt.incubator.apache.org>\" pkg.homepage: \"http://mynewt.apache.org/\" pkg.keywords: pkg.deps: - \"@apache-mynewt-core/libs/os\" - \"@apache-mynewt-core/hw/hal\" - \"@apache-mynewt-core/libs/console/full\" Packages have a few features worth noting: Dependencies: Packages can rely upon other packages, and when they do they will inherit their functionality (header files, library definitions, etc.) APIs: Packages can export named APIs, and they can require that certain APIs be present, in order to compile. Features: Packages can operate differently depending on what named features are present in the system. Packages can also export features to the rest of the Mynewt system. Everything that newt knows about within a project's directory is a package. This makes it very clean and easy to write re-usable components, which can describe their Dependencies and APIs to the rest of the system. Target A target in Apache Mynewt is very similar to a target in make . It is the collection of parameters that must be passed to Newt in order to generate a reproducible build. A target represents the top of the build tree, and any packages or parameters specified at the target level, cascade down to all dependencies. Targets are also packages, and are stored in the targets/ directory at the base of your project. Most targets consist of: app : The application to build. bsp : The board support package to combine with that application build_profile : Either debug or optimized . Targets can also have additional items specified, including: cflags : Any additional compiler flags you might want to specify to the build. features : Any system level features you want to enable. In order to create and manipulate targets, the newt tool offers a set of helper commands, you can find more information about these by issuing: $ newt target Usage: newt target [flags] newt target [command] Available Commands: show View target configuration variables set Set target configuration variable create Create a target delete Delete target copy Copy target vars Show variable names Flags: -h, --help=false: help for target Global Flags: -l, --loglevel=\"WARN\": Log level, defaults to WARN. -o, --outfile=\"\": Filename to tee log output to -q, --quiet=false: Be quiet; only display error output. -s, --silent=false: Be silent; don't output anything. -v, --verbose=false: Enable verbose output when executing commands.

The library of basic system calls and facilities compiles to less than 5kB total on Cortex-M3, and much less if some functions aren't used. The code is based on klibc and tinyprintf modules, and licensed under the BSD license.

Baselibc optimizes for size rather than performance, which is usually a more important goal in embedded environments. How to switch to baselibc In order to switch from using libc to using baselibc you have to add the baselibc pkg as a dependency in the project pkg.

The text written on the console brings some information and is a sequence of characters sent by the OS or programs running on the OS. Support is currently available for console access via the serial port on the hardware board. Description In the Mynewt OS, the console library comes in two versions: full - containing the full implementation stub - containing stubs for the API Both of these have pkg.yml file which states that they provide the console API. If a pkg uses this API, it should list console as a requirement. For example, the shell pkg is defined by the following pkg.yml file: pkg.name: libs/shell pkg.vers: 0.1 pkg.deps: - libs/os - libs/util pkg.reqs: - console pkg.identities: - SHELL The project .yml file decides which version of the console pkg should be included. If project requires the full console capability it lists dependency libs/console/full in its pkg.yml file. On the other hand, a project may not have a physical console (e.g. a UART port to connect a terminal to) but may have a dependency on a pkg that has console capability. In that case you would use a console stub. Another example would be the bootloader project where we want to keep the size of the image small. It includes the libs/os pkg that can print out messages on a console (e.g. if there is a hard fault) and the libs/util pkg that uses full console (but only if SHELL is present to provide a CLI). However, we do not want to use any console I/O capability in this particular bootloader project to keep the size small. We simply use the console stub instead, and the pkg.yml file for the project boot pkg looks like the following: project.name: boot project.identities: bootloader project.pkgs: - libs/os - libs/bootutil - libs/nffs - libs/console/stub - libs/util Console has 2 modes for transmit; blocking mode and non-blocking mode . Usually the non-blocking mode is the active one; the output buffer is drained by getting TX completion interrupts from hardware, and more data is added based on these interrupts. Blocking mode is used when we don't want TX completion interrupts. It is used when system crashes, and we still want to output info related to that crash. Console, by default, echoes everything it receives back. Terminal programs expect this, and is a way for the user to know that the console is connected and responsive.

This file system is designed with two priorities that makes it suitable for embedded use: Minimal RAM usage Reliability Mynewt also provides an abstraction layer API (fs) to allow you to swap out nffs with a different file system of your choice. Description Areas At the top level, an nffs disk is partitioned into areas . An area is a region of disk with the following properties: An area can be fully erased without affecting any other areas. Writing to one area does not restrict writes to other areas. Regarding property 1: Generally, flash hardware divides its memory space into \"blocks.\" When erasing flash, entire blocks must be erased in a single operation; partial erases are not possible. Regarding property 2: Furthermore, some flash hardware imposes a restriction with regards to writes: writes within a block must be strictly sequential. For example, if you wish to write to the first 16 bytes of a block, you must write bytes 1 through 15 before writing byte 16. This restriction only applies at the block level; writes to one block have no effect on what parts of other blocks can be written. Thus, each area must comprise a discrete number of blocks. Initialization Before nffs can be used, it must be initialized. There are two means of initializing an nffs file system: Restore an existing file system via detection. Create a new file system via formatting. A typical initialization sequence is the following: Detect an nffs file system in a specific region of flash. If no file system was detected, format a new file system in the same flash region. Both methods require the user to describe how the flash memory should be divided into nffs areas. This is accomplished with an array of struct nffs_area_desc . Typically, a product's flash layout is exposed via its BSP-specific bsp_flash_dev() function. This function retrieves the layout of the specified flash device resident in the BSP. The result of this function can then be converted into the struct nffs_area_desc[] that nffs requires. The below example, taken from the slinky project, illustrates the nffs initialization procedure. /*** hw/hal/include/hal/flash_map.h */ /* * Flash area types */ #define FLASH_AREA_BOOTLOADER 0 #define FLASH_AREA_IMAGE_0 1 #define FLASH_AREA_IMAGE_1 2 #define FLASH_AREA_IMAGE_SCRATCH 3 #define FLASH_AREA_NFFS 4 /*** project/slinky/src/main.c */ int main ( int argc , char **argv ) { int rc ; int cnt ; /* NFFS_AREA_MAX is defined in the BSP-specified bsp.h header file. */ struct nffs_area_desc descs [ NFFS_AREA_MAX ]; /* Initialize nffs's internal state. */ rc = nffs_init (); assert ( rc == 0 ); /* Convert the set of flash blocks we intend to use for nffs into an array * of nffs area descriptors. */ cnt = NFFS_AREA_MAX ; rc = flash_area_to_nffs_desc ( FLASH_AREA_NFFS , &cnt , descs ); assert ( rc == 0 ); /* Attempt to restore an existing nffs file system from flash. */ if ( nffs_detect ( descs ) == FS_ECORRUPT ) { /* No valid nffs instance detected; format a new one. */ rc = nffs_format ( descs ); assert ( rc == 0 ); } /* [ ... ] */ } After nffs has been initialized, the application can access the file system via the file system abstraction layer .

There are two types of objects: inodes and data blocks . An inode represents a file or directory; a data block represents part of a file's contents. /** On-disk representation of an inode (file or directory). */ struct nffs_disk_inode { uint32_t ndi_magic ; /* NFFS_INODE_MAGIC */ uint32_t ndi_id ; /* Unique object ID. */ uint32_t ndi_seq ; /* Sequence number; greater supersedes lesser. */ uint32_t ndi_parent_id ; /* Object ID of parent directory inode. */ uint8_t reserved8 ; uint8_t ndi_filename_len ; /* Length of filename, in bytes. */ uint16_t ndi_crc16 ; /* Covers rest of header and filename. */ /* Followed by filename. */ }; An inode filename's length cannot exceed 256 bytes.

Together, the set of blocks in a file form a reverse singly-linked list. The maximum number of data bytes that a block can contain is determined at initialization-time. The result is the greatest number which satisfies all of the following restrictions: No more than 2048. At least two maximum-sized blocks can fit in the smallest area. The 2048 number was chosen somewhat arbitrarily, and may change in the future. ID space All disk objects have a unique 32-bit ID. The ID space is partitioned as follows: ID range Node type 0x00000000 - 0x0fffffff Directory inodes 0x10000000 - 0x7fffffff File inodes 0x80000000 - 0xfffffffe Data blocks 0xffffffff Reserved (NFFS_ID_NONE) Scratch area A valid nffs file system must contain a single \"scratch area.\" The scratch area does not contain any objects of its own, and is only used during garbage collection. The scratch area must have a size greater than or equal to each of the other areas in flash. RAM representation Every object in the file system is stored in a 256-entry hash table. An object's hash key is derived from its 32-bit ID. Each list in the hash table is sorted by time of use; most-recently-used is at the front of the list. All objects are represented by the following structure: /** * What gets stored in the hash table. Each entry represents a data block or * an inode. */ struct nffs_hash_entry { SLIST_ENTRY ( nffs_hash_entry ) nhe_next ; uint32_t nhe_id ; /* 0 - 0x7fffffff if inode; else if block. */ uint32_t nhe_flash_loc ; /* Upper-byte = area idx; rest = area offset. */ }; For each data block, the above structure is all that is stored in RAM. To acquire more information about a data block, the block header must be read from flash. Inodes require a fuller RAM representation to capture the structure of the file system. There are two types of inodes: files and directories . Each inode hash entry is actually an instance of the following structure: /** Each inode hash entry is actually one of these. */ struct nffs_inode_entry { struct nffs_hash_entry nie_hash_entry ; SLIST_ENTRY ( nffs_inode_entry ) nie_sibling_next ; union { struct nffs_inode_list nie_child_list ; /* If directory */ struct nffs_hash_entry *nie_last_block_entry ; /* If file */ }; uint8_t nie_refcnt ; }; A directory inode contains a list of its child files and directories ( fie_child_list ). These entries are sorted alphabetically using the ASCII character set. A file inode contains a pointer to the last data block in the file ( nie_last_block_entry ). For most file operations, the reversed block list must be walked backwards. This introduces a number of speed inefficiencies: All data blocks must be read to determine the length of the file. Data blocks often need to be processed sequentially. The reversed nature of the block list transforms this from linear time to an O(n^2) operation. Furthermore, obtaining information about any constituent data block requires a separate flash read. Inode cache and Data Block cache The speed issues are addressed by a pair of caches. Cached inodes entries contain the file length and a much more convenient doubly-linked list of cached data blocks. The benefit of using caches is that the size of the caches need not be proportional to the size of the file system. In other words, caches can address speed efficiency concerns without negatively impacting the file system's scalability. nffs requires both caches during normal operation, so it is not possible to disable them. However, the cache sizes are configurable, and both caches can be configured with a size of one if RAM usage must be minimized. The following data structures are used in the inode and data block caches. /** Full data block representation; not stored permanently in RAM. */ struct nffs_block { struct nffs_hash_entry *nb_hash_entry ; /* Points to real block entry. */ uint32_t nb_seq ; /* Sequence number; greater supersedes lesser. */ struct nffs_inode_entry *nb_inode_entry ; /* Owning inode. */ struct nffs_hash_entry *nb_prev ; /* Previous block in file. */ uint16_t nb_data_len ; /* # of data bytes in block. */ uint16_t reserved16 ; }; /** Represents a single cached data block. */ struct nffs_cache_block { TAILQ_ENTRY ( nffs_cache_block ) ncb_link ; /* Next / prev cached block. */ struct nffs_block ncb_block ; /* Full data block. */ uint32_t ncb_file_offset ; /* File offset of this block. */ }; /** Full inode representation; not stored permanently in RAM. */ struct nffs_inode { struct nffs_inode_entry *ni_inode_entry ; /* Points to real inode entry. */ uint32_t ni_seq ; /* Sequence number; greater supersedes lesser. */ struct nffs_inode_entry *ni_parent ; /* Points to parent directory. */ uint8_t ni_filename_len ; /* # chars in filename. */ uint8_t ni_filename [ NFFS_SHORT_FILENAME_LEN ]; /* First 3 bytes. */ }; /** Doubly-linked tail queue of cached blocks; contained in cached inodes. */ TAILQ_HEAD ( nffs_block_cache_list , nffs_block_cache_entry ); /** Represents a single cached file inode. */ struct nffs_cache_inode { TAILQ_ENTRY ( nffs_cache_inode ) nci_link ; /* Sorted; LRU at tail. */ struct nffs_inode nci_inode ; /* Full inode. */ struct nffs_cache_block_list nci_block_list ; /* List of cached blocks. */ uint32_t nci_file_size ; /* Total file size. */ }; Only file inodes are cached; directory inodes are never cached. Within a cached inode, all cached data blocks are contiguous. E.g., if the start and end of a file are cached, then the middle must also be cached. A data block is only cached if its owning file is also cached. Internally, cached inodes are stored in a singly-linked list, ordered by time of use. The most-recently-used entry is the first element in the list. If a new inode needs to be cached, but the inode cache is full, the least-recently-used entry is freed to make room for the new one. The following operations cause an inode to be cached: Querying a file's length. Seeking within a file. Reading from a file. Writing to a file. The following operations cause a data block to be cached: Reading from the block. Writing to the block. If one of the above operations is applied to a data block that is not currently cached, nffs uses the following procedure to cache the necessary block: If none of the owning inode's blocks are currently cached, allocate a cached block entry corresponding to the requested block and insert it into the inode's list. Else if the requested file offset is less than that of the first cached block, bridge the gap between the inode's sequence of cached blocks and the block that now needs to be cached. This is accomplished by caching each block in the gap, finishing with the requested block. Else (the requested offset is beyond the end of the cache), If the requested offset belongs to the block that immediately follows the end of the cache, cache the block and append it to the list. Else, clear the cache, and populate it with the single entry corresponding to the requested block. If the system is unable to allocate a cached block entry at any point during the above procedure, the system frees up other blocks currently in the cache. This is accomplished as follows: Iterate the inode cache in reverse (i.e., start with the least-recently-used entry). For each entry: If the entry's cached block list is empty, advance to the next entry. Else, free all the cached blocks in the entry's list. Because the system imposes a minimum block cache size of one, the above procedure will always reclaim at least one cache block entry. The above procedure may result in the freeing of the block list that belongs to the very inode being operated on. This is OK, as the final block to get cached is always the block being requested. Detection The file system detection process consists of scanning a specified set of flash regions for valid nffs areas, and then populating the RAM representation of the file system with the detected objects. Detection is initiated with the nffs_detect() function. Not every area descriptor passed to nffs_detect() needs to reference a valid nffs area. Detection is successful as long as a complete file system is detected somewhere in the specified regions of flash. If an application is unsure where a file system might be located, it can initiate detection across the entire flash region. A detected file system is valid if: At least one non-scratch area is present. At least one scratch area is present (only the first gets used if there is more than one). The root directory inode is present. During detection, each indicated region of flash is checked for a valid area header. The contents of each valid non-scratch area are then restored into the nffs RAM representation. The following procedure is applied to each object in the area: Verify the object's integrity via a crc16 check. If invalid, the object is discarded and the procedure restarts on the next object in the area. Convert the disk object into its corresponding RAM representation and insert it into the hash table. If the object is an inode, its reference count is initialized to 1, indicating ownership by its parent directory. If an object with the same ID is already present, then one supersedes the other. Accept the object with the greater sequence number and discard the other. If the object references a nonexistent inode (parent directory in the case of an inode; owning file in the case of a data block), insert a temporary \"dummy\" inode into the hash table so that inter-object links can be maintained until the absent inode is eventually restored. Dummy inodes are identified by a reference count of 0. If a delete record for an inode is encountered, the inode's parent pointer is set to null to indicate that it should be removed from RAM. If nffs encounters an object that cannot be identified (i.e., its magic number is not valid), it scans the remainder of the flash area for the next valid magic number. Upon encountering a valid object, nffs resumes the procedure described above. After all areas have been restored, a sweep is performed across the entire RAM representation so that invalid inodes can be deleted from memory. For each directory inode: If its reference count is 0 (i.e., it is a dummy), migrate its children to the /lost+found directory, and delete it from the RAM representation. This should only happen in the case of file system corruption. If its parent reference is null (i.e., it was deleted), delete it and all its children from the RAM representation. For each file inode: If its reference count is 0 (i.e., it is a dummy), delete it from the RAM representation. This should only happen in the case of file system corruption. (We should try to migrate the file to the lost+found directory in this case, as mentioned in the todo section). When an object is deleted during this sweep, it is only deleted from the RAM representation; nothing is written to disk. When objects are migrated to the lost+found directory, their parent inode reference is permanently updated on the disk. In addition, a single scratch area is identified during the detection process. The first area whose fda_id value is set to 0xff is designated as the file system scratch area. If no valid scratch area is found, the cause could be that the system was restarted while a garbage collection cycle was in progress. Such a condition is identified by the presence of two areas with the same ID. In such a case, the shorter of the two areas is erased and designated as the scratch area. Formatting A new nffs file system is created via formatting. Formatting is achieved via the nffs_format() function. During a successful format, an area header is written to each of the specified locations. One of the areas in the set is designated as the initial scratch area. Flash writes The nffs implementation always writes in a strictly sequential fashion within an area. For each area, the system keeps track of the current offset. Whenever an object gets written to an area, it gets written to that area's current offset, and the offset is increased by the object's disk size. When a write needs to be performed, the nffs implementation selects the appropriate destination area by iterating though each area until one with sufficient free space is encountered. There is no write buffering. Each call to a write function results in a write operation being sent to the flash hardware. New objects Whenever a new object is written to disk, it is assigned the following properties: ID: A unique value is selected from the 32-bit ID space, as appropriate for the object's type. Sequence number: 0 When a new file or directory is created, a corresponding inode is written to flash. Likewise, a new data block also results in the writing of a corresponding disk object. Moving/Renaming files and directories When a file or directory is moved or renamed, its corresponding inode is rewritten to flash with the following properties: ID: Unchanged Sequence number: Previous value plus one. Parent inode: As specified by the move / rename operation. Filename: As specified by the move / rename operation. Because the inode's ID is unchanged, all dependent objects remain valid. Unlinking files and directories When a file or directory is unlinked from its parent directory, a deletion record for the unlinked inode gets written to flash. The deletion record is an inode with the following properties: ID: Unchanged Sequence number: Previous value plus one. Parent inode ID: NFFS_ID_NONE When an inode is unlinked, no deletion records need to be written for the inode's dependent objects (constituent data blocks or child inodes). During the next file system detection, it is recognized that the objects belong to a deleted inode, so they are not restored into the RAM representation. If a file has an open handle at the time it gets unlinked, application code can continued to use the file handle to read and write data. All files retain a reference count, and a file isn't deleted from the RAM representation until its reference code drops to 0. Any attempt to open an unlinked file fails, even if the file is referenced by other file handles. Writing to a file The following procedure is used whenever the application code writes to a file. First, if the write operation specifies too much data to fit into a single block, the operation is split into several separate write operations. Then, for each write operation: Determine which existing blocks the write operation overlaps (n = number of overwritten blocks). If n = 0 , this is an append operation. Write a data block with the following properties: ID: New unique value. Sequence number: 0. Else (n > 1) , this write overlaps existing data. For each block in [1, 2, ... n-1] , write a new block containing the updated contents. Each new block supersedes the block it overwrites. That is, each block has the following properties: ID: Unchanged Sequence number: Previous value plus one. Write the nth block. The nth block includes all appended data, if any. As with the other blocks, its ID is unchanged and its sequence number is incremented. Appended data can only be written to the end of the file. That is, \"holes\" are not supported. Garbage collection When the file system is too full to accommodate a write operation, the system must perform garbage collection to make room. The garbage collection procedure is described below: The non-scratch area with the lowest garbage collection sequence number is selected as the \"source area.\" If there are other areas with the same sequence number, the one with the smallest flash offset is selected. The source area's ID is written to the scratch area's header, transforming it into a non-scratch ID. This former scratch area is now known as the \"destination area.\" The RAM representation is exhaustively searched for collectible objects. The following procedure is applied to each inode in the system: If the inode is resident in the source area, copy the inode record to the destination area. If the inode is a file inode, walk the inode's list of data blocks, starting with the last block in the file. Each block that is resident in the source area is copied to the destination area. If there is a run of two or more blocks that are resident in the source area, they are consolidated and copied to the destination area as a single new block (subject to the maximum block size restriction). The source area is reformatted as a scratch sector (i.e., is is fully erased, and its header is rewritten with an ID of 0xff). The area's garbage collection sequence number is incremented prior to rewriting the header. This area is now the new scratch sector.","title":"Internals"},{"location":"os/modules/fs/nffs/nffs_internals/#internals-of-nffs","text":"","title":"Internals of nffs"},{"location":"os/modules/fs/nffs/nffs_internals/#disk-structure","text":"On disk, each area is prefixed with the following header: /** On-disk representation of an area header. */ struct nffs_disk_area { uint32_t nda_magic [ 4 ]; /* NFFS_AREA_MAGIC{0,1,2,3} */ uint32_t nda_length ; /* Total size of area, in bytes. */ uint8_t nda_ver ; /* Current nffs version: 0 */ uint8_t nda_gc_seq ; /* Garbage collection count. */ uint8_t reserved8 ; uint8_t nda_id ; /* 0xff if scratch area. */ }; Beyond its header, an area contains a sequence of disk objects, representing the contents of the file system.

A secondary goal is to provide a simple consistent API to commonly used MCU components and peripherals to make development easier. Nothing in the HAL precludes the user of the underlying physical devices, it only limits the portability of the end application. Example A Mynewt contributor might write a light-switch module ( libs/light ) that provides the functionality of an intelligent light switch. This might involve using a timer, a General Purpose Output (GPO) to set the light to the on or off state, and flash memory to log the times the lights were turned on or off. The contributor would like this module to work with as many different hardware platforms as possible, but can't possibly test across the complete set of hardware supported by Mynewt. Solution : The contributor uses the HAL APIs to control the peripherals. The Mynewt team ensures that the underlying HAL devices all work equivalently through the HAL APIs. The contributors library is independent of the specifics of the hardware.

For example, in hal_gpio.h the device enumeration is the first argument to all methods and called pin . void hal_gpio_set(int pin); The device_id (in this case called pin ) is not a physical device (actual hardware pin), but a virtual pin which is defined by the implementation of the HAL (and documented in the implementation of the HAL) Below this, there are two different paradigms for HAL interface. They are discussed below. Direct HAL Interface In one HAL paradigm called direct HAL , the header file is the only component of the HAL interface. Implementers of this HAL would create a source file that implements these methods. This has the advantage of being simple, small, and low execution overhead. It has the disadvantage that its not possible to have two different implementations of the same direct HAL within the same image. Said another way, if I create a direct HAL hal_foo.h , there can be many implementations of xxx/hal_foo.c but only one can be included in a project. For example, support there is an ADC attached directly to the MCU and an ADC that is attached via SPI. There would be no way in this simple paradigm to use both these devices from the HAL API at the same time. Current Direct HAL interfaces include: Hal Name Interface File [hal_gpio] hal_gpio.h [hal_uart] hal_uart.h [hal_cputime] hal_cputime.h This brings up the second paradigm. Indirect HAL Interface The second paradigm, indirect HAL preserves the simple function API with enumerated device_id but adds a small layer of code in the HAL to allow different implementations to connect at runtime. The abstract interface contains three components: A header file hal_foo.h that includes the API above with a device_id An implementation hal/hal_foo.c which maps the device_id to a driver interface structure. A driver interface structure that is defined for the underlying implementation Using this simple model, the user can be exposed to a simple function interface (without structures or function pointers) and the system can provide a different software implementation for each device id. Although the GPIO interface for Mynewt uses the direct HAL , we can describe what it might look like for an indirect HAL. The API hal_gpio.h is identical with a direct or indirect HAL. In the indirect HAL there is an additional header file hal_gpio_int.h which describes the driver interface for underlying implementations. It looks similar to the HAL API except is driven by function pointers. struct hal_gpio_funcs { void (*hgpio_set)(void); . . . }; struct hal_gpio_int { struct hal_gpio_funcs funcs; } const struct hal_gpio_int *bsp_gpio_dev(uint8_t pin); The BSP specific function is what will map the specific pin (device_id) to its implementation. This is different than the direct HAL which maps this virtual/physical device pairing in the MCU implementation. For the indirect HAL the mapping has to be done in the BSP since that is the place where multiple disparate devices can be enumerated into a single device_id space. An interface file hal/hal_gpio.c would perform the mapping as follows: void hal_gpio_set(int pin) { const struct hal_gpio_int *pgpio; pgpio = bsp_get_gpio_device(pin); if(pgpio) { pgpio->funcs.set(); } } The implementer of GPIO functionality (say in mcu/xxx/hal_gpio.c ) would implement the structure and provide the function pointers. void xxx_hal_gpio_set(void) { /* implementation for this particular gpio device */ . . . } struct hal_gpio_int xxx_hal_gpio = { .funcs.hgpio_set = xxx_hal_gpio_set; } This leaves the BSP implementation to complete the function const struct hal_gpio_int *bsp_gpio_dev(uint8_t pin) { switch(pin) { case 0: return &xxx_hal_gpio; case 1: return &yyy_hal_gpio; } return NULL; } NOTE : In this example there could be 10s of GPIO.

Description Contains the basic operations to set and read General Purpose Digital I/O Pins within a Mynewt system. Individual GPIOs are referenced in the APIs as pins . However, in this interface the pins are virtual GPIO pins. The MCU hal driver maps these virtual pins to the physical GPIO ports and pins. Typically, the BSP code may define named I/O pins in terms of these virtual pins to describe the devices attached to the physical pins. Here's a brief example so you can get the gist of the translation. Suppose my product uses the stm32F4xx processor. There already exists support for this processor within Mynewt. The processor has N ports (A,B,C..) of 16 GPIO pins per port. The MCU hal_gpio driver maps these to a set of virtual pins 0-N where port A maps to 0-15, Port B maps to 16-31, Port C maps to 32-47 and so on. The exact number of physical port (and virtual port pins) depends on the specific variant of the stm32F4xx. So if I want to turn on port B pin 3, that would be virtual pin 1*16 + 3 = 19. This translation is defined in the MCU implementation of hal_gpio.c for the stmf32F4xx. Each MCU will typically have a different translation method depending on its GPIO architecture. Now, when writing a BSP, it's common to give names to the relevant port pins that you are using. Thus, the BSP may define a mapping between a function and a virtual port pin. For example #define SYSTEM_LED (37) #define FLASH_SPI_CHIP_SELECT (3) would map the system indicator LED to virtual pin 37 which on the stm32F4xx would be Port C pin 5 and the chip select line for the external SPI flash to virtual pin 3 which on the stm32F4xxis port A pin 3.

Individual GPIOs are referenced in the APIs as pins . However, in this interface the pins are virtual GPIO pins. The MCU hal driver maps these virtual pins to the physical GPIO ports and pins. Typically, the BSP code may define named I/O pins in terms of these virtual pins to describe the devices attached to the physical pins. Here's a brief example so you can get the gist of the translation. Suppose my product uses the stm32F4xx processor. There already exists support for this processor within Mynewt. The processor has N ports (A,B,C..) of 16 GPIO pins per port. The MCU hal_gpio driver maps these to a set of virtual pins 0-N where port A maps to 0-15, Port B maps to 16-31, Port C maps to 32-47 and so on. The exact number of physical port (and virtual port pins) depends on the specific variant of the stm32F4xx. So if I want to turn on port B pin 3, that would be virtual pin 1*16 + 3 = 19. This translation is defined in the MCU implementation of hal_gpio.c for the stmf32F4xx. Each MCU will typically have a different translation method depending on its GPIO architecture. Now, when writing a BSP, it's common to give names to the relevant port pins that you are using. Thus, the BSP may define a mapping between a function and a virtual port pin. For example #define SYSTEM_LED (37) #define FLASH_SPI_CHIP_SELECT (3) would map the system indicator LED to virtual pin 37 which on the stm32F4xx would be Port C pin 5 and the chip select line for the external SPI flash to virtual pin 3 which on the stm32F4xxis port A pin 3.

Description An Inter-Integrated Circuit (I\u00b2C ] I-squared-C) bus is a multi-master, multi-save serial interface used to connect components on a circuit board and often peripherals devices located off the circuit board. I2C is often though of as a 2-wire protocol because it uses two wires (SDA, SCL) to send data between devices. For a detailed description of I2C, see the I\u00b2C wikipedia page Definition hal_i2c.h HAL_I2C Theory Of Operation An I\u00b2C transaction typically involves acquiring the bus, sending and/or receiving data and release the bus. The bus acquisition portion is important because the bus is typically multi-master so other devices may be trying to read/write the same peripheral. HAL_I2C implements a master interface to the I\u00b2C bus. Typical usage of the interface would involve the following steps. initialize an I\u00b2C device using hal_i2c_init when you want to perform an I\u00b2C transaction: Issue the hal_i2c_begin() command. Issue one or more hal_i2c_read and/or hal_i2c_write commands Issue the hal_i2c_end() command. An addition API was added called hal_i2c_probe . This command combines hal_i2c_begin() , hal_i2c_read , and hal_i2c_end() to try to read 0-bytes from a specific bus address. its intended to provide an easy way to probe the bus for a specific device. NOTE: if the device is write-only, it will not appear with this command. HAL_I2C Data Data to read/write is passed to the hal_i2c APIs via the struct hal_i2c_master_data { uint8_t address; /* destination address */ uint16_t len; /* number of bytes to transmit or receive */ uint8_t *buffer; /* data buffer for transmit or receive */ }; buffer is a pointer to the data to send. len is the number of bytes to send over the bus. address is a 7-bit bus address of the device. When I\u00b2C builds its address, it uses the 7-bit address plus a 1-bit R/W (read/write) indicator to identify the device and direction of the transaction. Thus when using this API, you should use a 7-bit address in the data structure and ensure that address is a value between 0-127. As an example, consider an I\u00b2C device address that looks like this: B7 B6 B5 B4 B3 B2 B1 B0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 R/W MSB LSB In the HAL_I2C API you would communicate with this device with address 0b1000110 , which is hex 0x46 or decimal 70.

The clock source feeds the COUNTER register which is continuously counting (up or down), When the COUNTER is less than the value of the CAPTURE register, the PWM outputs a logic HIGH. When the counter is greater than the CAPTURE register the PWM outputs logic LOW. When the counter reaches the TOP register, it wraps back to zero. If the PWM has no TOP register, it simply wraps back to zero after reaching 2^N-1. The HAL_PWM abstracts this implementation and provides methods to set the PWM frequency and duty cycle.

For a detailed description of SPI, see Wikipedia . Description The Mynewt HAL interface supports the SPI master functionality only. Future version will support SPI slave functionality. Definition hal_spi.h HAL_SPI Theory Of Operation SPI is called a 4-wire interface because of the 4 signals, MISO, MOSI, CLK, and SS. The SS signal (slave select) is an active low signal that activates a SPI slave device. This is how a master \"addresses\" a particular slave device. Often this signal is also referred to as \"chip select\" as it selects particular slave device for communications. The Mynewt SPI HAL has blocking transfers. This means that the API call to transfer a byte will wait until the byte completes transmissions before the function returns. Since SPI is generally a shared communications bus, the hal_spi API allows SPI runtime configuration to be compatible with the data format and speed of the slave device. See the hal_spi_config method in the API above for a description of the available settings. These settings are critical to the operation of the slave device. The Mynewt SPI HAL does not include built-in SS signaling. Its up to the hal_spi user to control their own SS pins. Typically applications will do this with GPIO.

Description Logging API is provided in apache-mynewt-core/sys/log/include/log/log.h . It allows packages to define their own log streams with separate names. It also allows an application to control the output destinations of logs. Compile Time Settings To save space at compile time, there is a compile time log level that includes/excludes certain logs at compile time, saving image space. For example, during debug, you can have significant logs present, but disable these at compile time to ensure the code size limits are met. A compiler flag LOG_LEVEL can be set in your target.cflags or within your app pkg.cflags files to set the compile time log level. The log level are defined in apache-mynewt-core/sys/log/include/log/log.h but must be added by number to your yml file. For example: pkg.cflags -DLOG_LEVEL=8 or newt target set my_target cflags=-DLOG_LEVEL=8 would both set the compile-time log level to LOG_LEVEL_ERROR . All logs of less than LOG_LEVEL_ERROR severity would be disabled at compile time and take no space within the Mynewt application image. These compile time settings are applicable to all logs registered with the system. Log Each log stream requires a log structure to define its logging properties. It is typical for modules to extern this structure. Log Handler To use logs, a log-handler is required, which is responsible for handling the I/O from the log. The log package comes with two pre-built log handlers. console -- streams log events directly to the console port. Does not support walking and reading. cbmem -- writes/reads log events to a circular buffer. Supports walking and reading for access by newtmgr and shell commands. In addition, it is possible to create custom log handlers for other methods. Examples may include Flash file system Flat flash buffer Streamed over some other interface To use logging, you will not typically need to create your own log handler. You can use one of the two supplied above. In Mynewt today, each module will register its logs with a default log handler. Its up to the application to use or override this log handler for its specific purposes. See below for an example.

Protocol handler (libs/newtmgr) registers itself using shell_nlip_input_register() , and shell calls the registered handler for every frame. Outgoing frames for the protocol are sent using shell_nlip_output() . Create a sim target to check out these commands available in shell. user@~/dev/larva$ newt target create blinky_sim Creating target blinky_sim Target blinky_sim successfully created! user@~/dev/larva$ newt target set blinky_sim name=blinky_sim Target blinky_sim successfully set name to blinky_sim user@~/dev/larva$ newt target set blinky_sim arch=sim Target blinky_sim successfully set arch to sim user@~/dev/larva$ newt target set blinky_sim project=blinky Target blinky_sim successfully set project to blinky user@~/dev/larva$ newt target set blinky_sim bsp=hw/bsp/native Target blinky_sim successfully set bsp to hw/bsp/native user@~/dev/larva$ newt target set blinky_sim compiler_def=debug Target blinky_sim successfully set compiler_def to debug user@~/dev/larva$ newt target set blinky_sim compiler=sim Target blinky_sim successfully set compiler to sim user@~/dev/larva$ newt target show blinky_sim arch: sim bsp: hw/bsp/native compiler: sim compiler_def: debug name: blinky_sim project: blinky user@~/dev/larva$ newt target build blinky_sim Building target blinky_sim (project = blinky) Compiling case.c Compiling suite.c Compiling testutil.c .. ..

This allows easy integration of statistics for troubleshooting, maintenance, and usage monitoring. By creating and registering your statistics, they are automatically included in the Newtmgr shell and console APIs. Implementation Details A statistic is an unsigned integer that can be set by the code. When building stats, the implementer chooses the size of the statistic depending on the frequency of the statistic and the resolution required before the counter wraps. Typically the stats are incremented upon code events; however, they are not limted to that purpose. Stats are organized into sections. Each section of stats has its own name and can be queried separately through the API. Each section of stats also has its own statistic size, allowing the user to separate large (64-bit) statistics from small (16 bit statistics). NOTE: It is not currently possible to group different size stats into the same section. Please ensure all stats in a section have the same size. Stats sections are currently stored in a single global stats group. Statistics are stored in a simple structure which contains a small stats header followed by a list of stats. The stats header contains: struct stats_hdr { char *s_name ; uint8_t s_size ; uint8_t s_cnt ; uint16_t s_pad1 ; #ifdef STATS_NAME_ENABLE struct stats_name_map *s_map ; int s_map_cnt ; #endif STAILQ_ENTRY ( stats_hdr ) s_next ; }; Compile Time Options When building your app, there is a single compile time option for statistics. When querying statistics, they are always queried by number, but if you want to see the results by name, you need to define STATS_NAME_ENABLE . This is defined using pkg.clfags: -DSTATS_NAME_ENABLE in your apps pkg.yml file or target.clfags: -DSTATS_NAME_ENABLE in your target definition. Enabling stat names provides better descriptions in the reported stats, but takes code space to store the strings within the image. Adding Stats to your code. Creating new stats table requires the following steps. Include the stats header file Define a stats section Declare an instance of the section Define the stat sections names table Implement stat in your code Initialize the stats Register the stats Include the stats header file Add the stats library to your pkg.yml file for your package or app by adding this line to your package dependencies. pkg.deps: - \"@apache-mynewt-core/sys/stats\" Add this include directive to code files using the stats library. #include <stats/stats.h> Define a stats section You must use the stats.h macros to define your stats table. A stats section definition looks like this. STATS_SECT_START(my_stat_section) STATS_SECT_ENTRY(attempt_stat) STATS_SECT_ENTRY(error_stat) STATS_SECT_END In this case we chose to make the stats 32-bits each. stats.h supports three different stats sizes through the following macros: STATS_SIZE_16 -- stats are 16 bits (wraps at 65536) STATS_SIZE_32 -- stats are 32 bits (wraps at 4294967296) STATS_SIZE_64 -- stats are 64-bits When this compiles/pre-processes, it produces a structure definition like this struct stats_my_stat_section { struct stats_hdr s_hdr; uint32_t sattempt_stat; uint32_t serror_stat; }; You can see that the defined structure has a small stats structure header and the two stats we have defined. Depending on whether these stats are used in multiple modules, you may need to include this definition in a header file. Declaring a variable to hold the stats Declare the global variable to hold your statistics. Since it is possible to have multiple copies of the same section (for example a stat section for each of 5 identical peripherals), the variable name of the stats section must be unique. STATS_SECT_DECL(my_stat_section) g_mystat; Again, if your stats section is used in multiple C files you will need to include the above definition in one of the C files and 'extern' this declaration in your header file. extern STATS_SECT_DECL(my_stat_section) g_mystat; Define the stats section name table Whether or not you are using STATS_NAME_ENABLE , you must define a stats name table. If STATS_NAME_ENABLE is not enabled, this will not take any code space or image size. /* define a few stats for querying */ STATS_NAME_START(my_stat_section) STATS_NAME(my_stat_section, attempt_stat) STATS_NAME(my_stat_section, error_stat) STATS_NAME_END(my_stat_section) When compiled by the preprocessor, it creates a structure that looks like this. struct stats_name_map g_stats_map_my_stat_section[] = { { __builtin_offsetof (struct stats_my_stat_section, sattempt_stat), \"attempt_stat\" }, { __builtin_offsetof (struct stats_my_stat_section, serror_stat), \"error_stat\" }, }; This table will allow the UI components to find a nice string name for the stat. Implement stats in your code. You can use the STATS_INC or STATS_INCN macros to increment your statistics within your C-code. For example, your code may do this: STATS_INC(g_mystat, attempt_stat); rc = do_task(); if(rc == ERR) { STATS_INC(g_mystat, error_stat); } Initialize the statistics You must initialize the stats so they can be operated on by the stats library. As per our example above, it would look like the following. This tells the system how large each statistic is and the number of statistics in the section. It also initialize the name information for the statistics if enabled as shown above. rc = stats_init( STATS_HDR(g_mystat), STATS_SIZE_INIT_PARMS(g_mystat, STATS_SIZE_32), STATS_NAME_INIT_PARMS(my_stat_section)); assert(rc == 0); Register the statistic section If you want the system to know about your stats, you must register them. rc = stats_register(\"my_stats\", STATS_HDR(g_mystat)); assert(rc == 0); There is also a method that does initialization and registration at the same time, called stats_init_and_reg . Retrieving stats through console or Newtmgr If you enable console in your project you can see stats through the serial port defined. This is the stats as shown from the example above with names enabled. stat my_stats 12274:attempt_stat: 3 12275:error_stat: 0 This is the stats as shown from the example without names enabled. stat my_stats 29149:s0: 3 29150:s1: 0 A note on multiple stats sections If you are implementing a device with multiple instances, you may want multiple stats sections with the exact same format. For example, suppose I write a driver for an external distance sensor. My driver supports up to 5 sensors and I want to record the stats of each device separately.

You would use it to build regression tests for your library. Description A package may optionally contain a set of test cases. Test cases are not normally compiled and linked when a package is built; they are only included when the \"test\" identity is specified. All of a package's test code goes in its src/test directory. For example, the nffs package's test code is located in the following directory: * fs/nffs/src/test/ This directory contains the source and header files that implement the nffs test code. The test code has access to all the header files in the following directories: * src * src/arch/<target-arch> * include * src/test * src/test/arch/<target-arch> * include directories of all package dependencies Package test code typically depends on the testutil package, described later in this document. Some test cases or test initialization code may be platform-specific. In such cases, the platform-specific function definitions are placed in arch subdirectories within the package test directory. While building the test code (i.e., when the test identity is specified), the newt tool defines the TEST macro. This macro is defined during compilation of all C source files in all projects and packages. Tests are structured according to the following hierarchy: [test] / \\ [suite] [suite] / \\ / \\ [case] [case] [case] [case] I.e., a test consists of test suites, and a test suite consists of test cases. The test code uses testutil to define test suites and test cases. Regression test can then be executed using 'newt target test' command, or by including a call to your test suite from project/test/src/test.c . Example This Tutorial shows how to create a test suite for a Mynewt package.

This should be populated before tu_init() is called. List of Functions The functions, and macros available in testutil are: Function Description tu_init Initializes the test framework according to the contents of the tu_config struct. TEST_ASSERT Asserts that the specified condition is true. TEST_PASS Reports a success result for the current test. TEST_SUITE Declares a test suite function. TEST_CASE Defines a test case function.

You also need to point the package dependencies to point to packages in apache-mynewt-core repository.

To start development of the driver, you first need to create a package description for it, and add stubs for sources. So you add few files. pkg.yml to describe the driver, and then header stub followed by source stub.

Here's from apps/air_quality/pkg.yml pkg.name: apps/air_quality pkg.type: app pkg.description: Air quality sensor test pkg.keywords: pkg.deps: - \"@apache-mynewt-core/libs/console/full\" - \"@apache-mynewt-core/libs/newtmgr\" - \"@apache-mynewt-core/libs/os\" - \"@apache-mynewt-core/libs/shell\" - \"@apache-mynewt-core/sys/config\" - \"@apache-mynewt-core/sys/log\" - \"@apache-mynewt-core/sys/stats\" - \"@apache-mynewt-core/libs/baselibc\" - libs/my_drivers/senseair And add a call to your main() to initialize this driver.

Add CLI commands for testing drivers While developing the driver, you want to issue operations from console asking it to do stuff. The way to do this is to register your command handler with shell. Whenever your custom command is issued, you can respond to it. The way you do this is first adding a dependency to shell package for your senseair driver. So you change libs/my_drivers/senseair/pkg.yml to have the following: pkg.name: libs/my_drivers/senseair pkg.deps: - \"@apache-mynewt-core/hw/hal\" - \"@apache-mynewt-core/libs/shell\" And then register your shell command in senseair_init() . [user@IsMyLaptop:~/src/air_quality]$ cat libs/my_drivers/senseair/src/senseair.c .... #include <shell/shell.h> #include <console/console.h> static int senseair_shell_func ( int argc , char **argv ); static struct shell_cmd senseair_cmd = { . sc_cmd = \"senseair\" , . sc_cmd_func = senseair_shell_func , }; void senseair_init ( void ) { int rc ; rc = shell_cmd_register ( &senseair_cmd ); assert ( rc == 0 ); } static int senseair_shell_func ( int argc , char **argv ) { console_printf ( \"Yay! Somebody called!\\n\" ); return 0 ; } Then you build this, download to target, and start minicom on your console port. You'll need to wire up your Board to a Serial converter first. On the STM32F3-Discovery Board pin PA9 is TX and pin PA10 is RX so wire PA9 to RX on your serial board, and PA10 to TX on your serial board. [user@IsMyLaptop:~]$ minicom -D /dev/tty.usbserial-AH02MIE2 Welcome to minicom 2.7 OPTIONS: Compiled on Oct 12 2015, 07:48:30.

Somebody called! Now that's great. You can connect the hardware to board and start developing code for the driver itself. Use of HAL for drivers The sensor has a serial port connection, and that's how you are going to connect to it. Your original BSP, hw/bsp/stm32f3discovery, has only one UART set up (as specified in src/hal_bsp.c, include/hal/bsp.h). Therefore, you need to create your own bsp which has configuration for this added hardware. So in the shell you make a copy of the original BSP, and then change the package file a little. [user@IsMyLaptop:~/src/air_quality]$ mkdir hw [user@IsMyLaptop:~/src/air_quality]$ mkdir hw/bsp [user@IsMyLaptop:~/src/air_quality]$ cp -R repos/mynewt_stm32f3/hw/bsp/stm32f3discovery hw/bsp/stm32f3discovery_with_senseair Then you modify the pkg.yml in the copied BSP to assign name for this package. And modify the dependency for MCU package to point to mynewt_stm32f3 repository. [user@IsMyLaptop:~/src/air_quality]$ grep pkg.name hw/bsp/stm32f3discovery_with_senseair/pkg.yml pkg.name: \"hw/bsp/stm32f3discovery_with_senseair\" [user@IsMyLaptop:~/src/air_quality]$ tail -2 hw/bsp/stm32f3discovery_with_senseair/pkg.yml pkg.deps: - \"@mynewt_stm32f3/hw/mcu/stm/stm32f3xx\" And you want to use this BSP with my target. So you change the BSP in the target definition. Here's your new target. [user@IsMyLaptop:~/src/air_quality]$ newt target show air_q targets/air_q app=apps/air_quality bsp=hw/bsp/stm32f3discovery_with_senseair build_profile=debug You add the 2nd serial port to my new BSP. Go to hw/bsp/stm32f3discovery_with_senseair directory to do this. Modify the include/hal/bsp.h to increase UART_CNT to 2, and add a definition of the 2nd logical UART. You will use this in your sensor driver. static const struct stm32f3_uart_cfg uart_cfg [ UART_CNT ] = { [ 0 ] = { . suc_uart = USART1 , . suc_rcc_cmd = RCC_APB2PeriphClockCmd , . suc_rcc_dev = RCC_APB2Periph_USART1 , . suc_pin_tx = 9 , . suc_pin_rx = 10 , . suc_pin_rts = 12 , . suc_pin_cts = 11 , . suc_pin_af = GPIO_AF_7 , . suc_irqn = USART1_IRQn }, [ 1 ] = { . suc_uart = USART2 , . suc_rcc_cmd = RCC_APB1PeriphClockCmd , . suc_rcc_dev = RCC_APB1Periph_USART2 , . suc_pin_tx = 19 , /* PB3 */ . suc_pin_rx = 20 , /* PB4 */ . suc_pin_rts = 1 , . suc_pin_cts = 0 , . suc_pin_af = GPIO_AF_7 , . suc_irqn = USART2_IRQn } }; With this in place, you can refer to serial port where your SenseAir sensor is by a logical number. This makes the code more platform independent - you could connect this sensor to another board, like Olimex. You will also use the HAL UART abstraction to do the UART port setup and data transfer. That way you don't need to have any platform dependent pieces within your little driver. You will now see what the driver code ends up looking like.

Once built using the newt tool, this application will blink the LED lights on the target board. This tutorial describes how to run Mynewt OS on Arduino Zero. Follow these simple steps and your board will be blinking in no time! Prerequisites Before tackling this tutorial, it's best to read about Mynewt in the Introduction section of this documentation. Equipment You will need the following equipment An Arduino Zero board. NOTE: There are many flavors of Arduino. Ensure that you have an Arduino Zero. See below for the versions of Arduino Zero that are compatible with this tutorial A computer that can connect to the Arduino Zero over USB A USB cable (Type A to micro B) that can connect the computer to the Arduino The Mynewt Release This tutorial has been tested on the following three Arduino Zero boards - Zero, M0 Pro, and Zero-Pro. Mynewt has not been tested on Arduino M0 which has no internal debugger support. Install Mynewt and Newt If you have not already done so, install Newt as shown in the Newt install tutorial If you have not already done so, create a project as shown in the Quick Start guide on how to Create Your First Project . Skip the testing and building the project steps in that tutorial since you will be defining a target for your Arduino board in this tutorial. Fetch External Packages Mynewt uses source code provided directly from the chip manufacturer for low level operations. Sometimes this code is licensed only for the specific manufacturer of the chipset and cannot live in the Apache Mynewt repository. That happens to be the case for the Arduino Zero board which uses Atmel SAMD21. Runtime's github repository hosts such external third-party packages and the Newt tool can fetch them. To fetch the package with MCU support for Atmel SAMD21 for Arduino Zero from the Runtime git repository, you need to add the repository to the project.yml file in your base project directory. Here is an example project.yml file with the Arduino Zero repository added.

In that case you will get an error message saying so and you will need to run newt upgrade to overwrite the existing files with the latest codebase. Create your bootloader target Next, you need to tell Newt what to build. For the Arduino Zero, we are going to generate both a bootloader, and an image target. To generate the bootloader target, you need to specify the following options. The output of the commands (indicating success) have been suppressed for easier readability. $ newt target create arduino_boot $ newt target set arduino_boot bsp=@mynewt_arduino_zero/hw/bsp/arduino_zero $ newt target set arduino_boot app=@apache-mynewt-core/apps/boot $ newt target set arduino_boot build_profile=optimized If you have an Arduino Zero Pro or M0 Pro, you have to set the following next: $ newt target set arduino_boot features=arduino_zero_pro If you have an Arduino Zero, you have to set the following instead: $ newt target set arduino_boot features=arduino_zero These commands do a few things: Create a target named arduino_boot , in order to build the Arduino Zero Bootloader. Set the application for the arduino_boot target to the default Apache Mynewt bootloader ( @apache-mynewt-core/apps/boot ) Set the board support package for the target to @mynewt_arduino_zero/hw/bsp/arduino_zero . This is a reference to the downloaded Arduino Zero support from Github. Use the \"optimized\" build profile for the arduino_boot target. This instructs Newt to generate smaller and more efficient code for this target. This setting is necessary due to the bootloader's strict size constraints. Tells the Board Support Package to enable support for the Arduino Zero Pro or the Arduino Zero. Set it to arduino_zero or arduino_zero_pro depending on the board you have. Build your bootloader Once you've configured the bootloader target, the next step is to build the bootloader for your Arduino. You can do this by using the newt build command: $ newt build arduino_boot Compiling asprintf.c Compiling atoi.c Compiling atol.c Compiling atoll.c Compiling bsearch.c Compiling bzero.c Compiling calloc.c Compiling fgets.c Compiling inline.c <snip> App successfully built: myproject/bin/arduino_boot/apps/boot/boot.elf If this command finishes successfully, you have successfully built the Arduino bootloader, and the next step is to build your application for the Arduino board. Build your blinky app To create and download your application, you create another target, this one pointing to the application you want to download to the Arduino board. In this tutorial, we will use the default application that comes with your project, apps/blinky : Note : Remember to set features to arduino_zero if your board is Arduino Zero and not a Pro! $ newt target create arduino_blinky Target targets/arduino_blinky successfully created $ newt target set arduino_blinky app=apps/blinky Target targets/arduino_blinky successfully set target.app to apps/blinky $ newt target set arduino_blinky bsp=@mynewt_arduino_zero/hw/bsp/arduino_zero Target targets/arduino_blinky successfully set target.bsp to @mynewt_arduino_zero/hw/bsp/arduino_zero $ newt target set arduino_blinky build_profile=debug Target targets/arduino_blinky successfully set target.build_profile to debug $ newt target set arduino_blinky features=arduino_zero_pro Target targets/arduino_blinky successfully set pkg.features to arduino_zero_pro $ You can now build the target, with newt build : $ newt build arduino_blinky Compiling main.c Archiving blinky.a Compiling cons_fmt.c Compiling cons_tty.c Archiving full.a Compiling case.c Compiling suite.c Compiling testutil.c Archiving testutil.a <snip> App successfully built: myproject/bin/arduino_blinky/apps/blinky/blinky.elf Congratulations! You have successfully built your application. Now it's time to load both the bootloader and application onto the target. Connect the Target Connect your computer to the Arduino Zero (from now on we'll call this the target) with the Micro-USB cable through the Programming Port as shown below. Mynewt will download and debug the target through this port. You should see a little green LED come on. That means the board has power. No external debugger is required. The Arduino Zero comes with an internal debugger that can be accessed by Mynewt. A image below shows the Arduino Zero Programming Port. Download the Bootloader Execute the command to download the bootloader. $ newt load arduino_boot If the newt tool finishes without error, that means the bootloader has been successfully loaded onto the target. Reminder if you are using Docker: When working with actual hardware, remember that each board has an ID. If you swap boards and do not refresh the USB Device Filter on the VirtualBox UI, the ID might be stale and the Docker instance may not be able to see the board correctly. For example, you may see an error message like Error: unable to find CMSIS-DAP device when you try to load or run an image on the board. In that case, you need to click on the USB link in VirtualBox UI, remove the existing USB Device Filter (e.g. \"Atmel Corp. EDBG CMSIS-DAP[0101]\") by clicking on the \"Removes selected USB filter\" button, and add a new filter by clicking on the \"Adds new USB filter\" button. Run the Image Now that the bootloader is downloaded to the target, the next step is to load your image onto the Arduino Zero. The easiest way to do this, is to use the newt run command. newt run will automatically rebuild your program (if necessary), create an image, and load it onto the target device. Here, we will load our arduino_blinky target onto the device, and we should see it run: $ newt run arduino_blinky 0.0.0 Debugging myproject/bin/arduino_blinky/apps/blinky/blinky.elf Open On-Chip Debugger 0.9.0 (2015-09-23-21:46) Licensed under GNU GPL v2 For bug reports, read http://openocd.org/doc/doxygen/bugs.html Info : only one transport option; autoselect 'swd' adapter speed: 500 kHz adapter_nsrst_delay: 100 cortex_m reset_config sysresetreq Info : CMSIS-DAP: SWD Supported Info : CMSIS-DAP: JTAG Supported Info : CMSIS-DAP: Interface Initialised (SWD) Info : CMSIS-DAP: FW Version = 01.1F.0118 Info : SWCLK/TCK = 1 SWDIO/TMS = 1 TDI = 1 TDO = 1 nTRST = 0 nRESET = 1 Info : CMSIS-DAP: Interface ready Info : clock speed 500 kHz Info : SWD IDCODE 0x0bc11477 Info : at91samd21g18.cpu: hardware has 4 breakpoints, 2 watchpoints GNU gdb (GNU Tools for ARM Embedded Processors) 7.8.0.20150604-cvs Copyright (C) 2014 Free Software Foundation, Inc.

You can run the newt tool natively on a computer running any of the three Operating System machines - OSX, Linux, or Windows. However, Mynewt OS images for a simulated target are built on the Windows machine by using Linux versions of the build software (newt)in a virtual machine on your Windows box. The Linux VM is set up by installing the Docker Toolbox. Your Windows machine will communicate with the Linux VM via transient ssh connections. You will then download a Docker image ( newtvm.exe )that allows you to run the newt commands in the Linux Docker instance. The Docker image contains: The newt command-line tool Go A multilib-capable native gcc / glibc An arm-none-eabi gcc Native gdb The sequence of events when using the Docker image is as follows: A new docker environment is created in the Linux VM. The specified command with the newtvm prefix ( newtvm newt command) is sent to the docker environment via ssh. The Linux command runs. The output from the command is sent back to Windows via ssh. The output is displayed in the Windows command prompt. Install Linux virtual machine Download the Docker Toolbox for Windows (version 1.9.0c or later) from https://www.docker.com/docker-toolbox . The Docker toolbox creates a consistently reproducible and self-contained environment in Linux. Run the Docker Toolbox installer. All the default settings are OK.

The delay is due to the fact that the tool must download the mynewt docker instance. You are now ready to proceed to building the image for the simulated target . Getting your Windows machine ready for hardware target When you want to produce images for actual hardware board on your Windows machine, go through the following setup procedure and then proceed to the blinky project on the Olimex board with this method. Installing some prerequisites You have to install the following if you do not have them already. The steps below indicate specific folders where each of these programs should be installed. You can choose different locations, but the remainder of this tutorial for a Windows machine assumes the specified folders. win-builds-i686 win-builds-x86_64 MSYS gcc for ARM openocd zadig git go win-builds (mingw64) 1.5 for i686 Download from http://win-builds.org/doku.php/download_and_installation_from_windows .

Specify the \"Use Git from the Windows Command Prompt\" option. The defaults for all other options are OK. Go Download the release for Microsoft Windows from https://golang.org/dl/ and install it \"C:\\Go\". Creating local repository The directory structure must be first readied for using Go. Go code must be kept inside a workspace. A workspace is a directory hierarchy with three directories at its root: src contains Go source files organized into packages (one package per directory), pkg contains package objects, and bin contains executable commands. The GOPATH environment variable specifies the location of your workspace. First create a 'dev' directory and then a 'go' directory under it. Set the GOPATH environment variable to this directory and then proceed to create the directory for cloning the newt tool repository. $ cd c :\\ $ mkdir dev\\go $ cd dev\\go Set the following user environment variables using the steps outlined here. * GOPATH : C : \\dev\\go * PATH : C : \\Program Files ( x86 ) \\GNU Tools ARM Embedded\\ 4.9 2015 q3\\bin ; %GOPATH%\\bin ; C : \\win-builds-x86_64\\bin ; C : \\win-builds-i686\\bin ; C : \\msys\\bin Steps: Right-click the start button Click \"Control panel\" Click \"System and Security\" Click \"System\" Click \"Advanced system settings\" in the left panel Click the \"Envoronment Variables...\" button There will be two sets of environment variables: user variables in the upper half of the screen, and system variables in the lower half. Configuring the user variables is recommended and tested (though system variables will work as well). Next, install godep. Note that the following command produces no output. $ go get github . com/tools/godep Set up the repository for the package building tool \"newt\" on your local machine. First create the appropriate directory for it and then clone the newt tool repository from the online apache repository (or its github.com mirror) into this newly created directory. Check the contents of the directory. $ go get git-wip-us . apache . org/repos/asf/incubator-mynewt-newt . git/newt $ dir bin pkg src $ dir src git-wip-us . apache . org github . com gopkg . in $ dir newt $ cd newt $ dir Godeps README . md coding_style . txt newt . go LICENSE cli design . txt Check that newt is in place. $ dir $GOPATH\\src\\git-wip-us . apache . org\\repos\\asf\\incubator-mynewt-newt . git\\newt Godeps README . md coding_style . txt newt . go LICENSE cli design . txt Building the newt tool You will use Go to run the newt.go program to build the newt tool. The command used is go install which compiles and writes the resulting executable to an output file named newt . It installs the results along with its dependencies in $GOPATH/bin. $ go install $ ls \"$GOPATH\" /bin/ godep incubator-mynewt-newt . git newt Try running newt using the compiled binary. For example, check for the version number by typing 'newt version'. See all the possible commands available to a user of newt by typing 'newt -h'. Note: If you are going to be be modifying the newt tool itself often and wish to compile the program every time you call it, you may want to define the newt environment variable that allows you to execute the command via %newt% . Use set newt=go run %GOPATH%\\src\\github.com\\mynewt\\newt\\newt.go or set it from the GUI. Here, you use go run which runs the compiled binary directly without producing an executable. $ newt version Newt version : 1.0 $ newt -h Newt allows you to create your own embedded project based on the Mynewt operating system . Newt provides both build and package management in a single tool , which allows you to compose an embedded workspace , and set of projects , and then build the necessary artifacts from those projects . For more information on the Mynewt operating system , please visit https : //www.github.com/mynewt/documentation. Please use the newt help command , and specify the name of the command you want help for , for help on how to use a specific command Usage : newt [ flags ] newt [ command ] Examples : newt newt help [ <command-name> ] For help on <command-name> . If not specified , print this message .

You can use it to get info about arrived hardware interrupts, callout expirations and messages from other tasks. The benefit of doing inter-task communication this way is that there should be less resources that need to be locked. The benefit of doing interrupt processing in a task context instead of inside an interrupt context is that you are not blocking other HW interrupts when doing the work. The same goes for high priority tasks in the system; they're blocked until the interrupt handler returns. From the task context you'll also be able to access other OS facilities; you can sleep while waiting for a lock, for example. Example app Here you are going to write an app which demonstrates the use of event queues for communication between tasks. You will also use OS callouts for timer expiration and another event from a GPIO interrupt. You will use inputs from 3 sources to toggle 3 GPIO outputs on my STM32F3discovery board. Create project You start by creating a project and populating it with repositories incubator-mynewt-core and mynewt_stm32f3. See STM32F3 tutorial if you need help with this. You can also read the tutorial on Additional Repositories for a more thorough understanding. Create application Here's what the pkg.yml looks for the application. [marko@IsMyLaptop:~/src/events]$ cat apps/event_sample/pkg.yml pkg.name: apps/event_sample pkg.type: app pkg.deps: - \"@apache-mynewt-core/libs/os\" - \"@apache-mynewt-core/hw/hal\" - \"@apache-mynewt-core/libs/console/stub\" Initialize the event queue structure This must be done before anyone tries to place events to the queue. Here it's done before any task gets created. Initialization is done by calling os_eventq_init() . #define MY_TASK_PRIO 4 #define MY_TASK_STACK_SZ 512 static struct os_eventq my_eventq ; static os_stack_t my_task_stack [ MY_TASK_STACK_SZ ]; static struct os_task my_task_str ; void init_tasks ( void ) { struct os_task taskid ; os_eventq_init ( &my_eventq ); os_task_init ( &my_task_str , \"task\" , my_task , NULL , MY_TASK_PRIO , OS_WAIT_FOREVER , my_task_stack , MY_TASK_STACK_SZ ); Processing events Here event processing is done inside my_task . The main loop of the task is pulling events from the queue, and then taking action. We look at the type of the event to figure out what to do. The code snippet shows what the main loop of the event handler looks like. Events are removed from the head of the queue using os_eventq_get void my_task ( void *arg ) { struct os_event *ev ; while ( 1 ) { ev = os_eventq_get ( &my_eventq ); switch ( ev->ev_type ) { /* more event types here */ default : assert ( 0 ); } } } Event types You can define your own event types. Some numbers are already reserved by the OS, so you should not use those as your own types. Reserved event types are defined in libs/os/include/os/os_eventq.h . One example of a reserved type is OS_EVENT_T_TIMER, which is used as type in OS callouts. You should start your event numbers from OS_EVENT_T_PERUSER , and go higher. You are going to generate events from GPIO interrupt handler, from another task as well as from a callout. OS callout already has a type, but you'll need to define types for the other uses. #define MY_TASK_GPIO_EVENT (OS_EVENT_T_PERUSER) #define MY_TASK_TASK_EVENT (OS_EVENT_T_PERUSER + 1) Posting events from another task Events are posted to a queue by calling os_eventq_put() . You need to preallocate memory for the event structure. Here it's done by declaring the event structure as a global variable. Note that you can call os_eventq_put() with an event which has already been queued. In that case, the call has no effect; the position of the event is not changed within the queue. In the code snippet we declare the os_event structure, and initialize it. We also create the event generating task, and periodically post event to the event queue. #define GEN_TASK_PRIO 3 #define GEN_TASK_STACK_SZ 512 static struct os_event gen_task_ev ; static os_stack_t gen_task_stack [ GEN_TASK_STACK_SZ ]; static struct os_task gen_task_str ; void gen_task ( void *arg ) { while ( 1 ) { os_time_delay ( OS_TICKS_PER_SEC / 4 ); os_eventq_put ( &my_eventq , &gen_task_ev ); } } void init_tasks ( void ) { /* .... */ gen_task_ev . ev_type = MY_TASK_TASK_EVENT ; os_task_init ( &gen_task_str , \"gen_task\" , gen_task , NULL , GEN_TASK_PRIO , OS_WAIT_FOREVER , gen_task_stack , GEN_TASK_STACK_SZ ); } Callout events You can get timer events delivered to your task's event queue with OS callout. Check callout documentation for description on how to use the API. For this example, you'll use only one type of callout; so you can use the simpler structure. In the code snippet we declare the os_callout structure and initialize it. Then we arm the timer. static struct os_callout my_callout ; void init_tasks ( void ) { /* .... */ os_callout_init ( &my_callout , &my_eventq , NULL ); os_callout_reset ( &my_callout , OS_TICKS_PER_SEC ); } Posting events from interrupt handler Another place where posting events makes sense is from an interrupt handler. In this tutorial you will do it when GPIO changes state. You'll use HAL GPIO interface to register a routine which is getting called from the interrupt handler context. This routine will then post event to your queue. On STM32F3Discovery board, there is a button connected to PA0. The identifier for this GPIO pin is 0. static struct os_event gpio_ev ; void init_tasks ( void ) { /* .... */ gpio_ev . ev_type = MY_TASK_GPIO_EVENT ; hal_gpio_irq_init ( 0 , my_gpio_irq , NULL , GPIO_TRIG_RISING , GPIO_PULL_NONE ); hal_gpio_irq_enable ( 0 ); } static void my_gpio_irq ( void *arg ) { os_eventq_put ( &my_eventq , &gpio_ev ); } Event processing finalized Now that you are posting events from different sources, you will fill in the parts in the task main loop to trigger different behaviors depending on event type. You'll drive different LEDs depending on what type of event arrived. LEDs on this board are connected to PE8, PE9, PE10 and so on. These have GPIO identifiers starting from 72 onwards. #define TASK_LED 72 #define CALLOUT_LED 73 #define GPIO_LED 74 void init_tasks ( void ) { /* .... */ hal_gpio_init_out ( TASK_LED , 1 ); hal_gpio_init_out ( CALLOUT_LED , 1 ); hal_gpio_init_out ( GPIO_LED , 1 ); } And here is the new main loop for your task.

The benefit of doing interrupt processing in a task context instead of inside an interrupt context is that you are not blocking other HW interrupts when doing the work.

B1_1/B1_0 and B0_1/B0_0 are PTH jumpers. Note that because the markings on the board may not always be accurate, when in doubt, you should always refer to the manual for the correct positioning. Since the jumpers are a pair, they should move together, and as such, the pair is responsible for the boot mode when bootloader is present. To locate the bootloader, the board searches in three places: User Flash Memory, System Memory or the Embedded SRAM. For this Blinky project, we will configure it to boot from flash by jumpering B0_0 and B1_0 . Connect USB-OTG#2 in the picture above to a USB port on your computer (or a powered USB hub to make sure there is enough power available to the board). The red PWR LED should be lit. Connect the JTAG connector to the SWD/JTAG interface on the board. The other end of the cable should be connected to the USB port or hub of your computer. Let's Go!

Specifically, this lesson will cover tasks, simple multitasking, and priority management running on an Arduino M0 Pro. Prerequisites Before starting, you should read about Mynewt in the Introduction section and complete the QuickStart guide and the Blinky tutorial. Furthermore, it may be helpful to take a peek at the task documentation for additional insights. Equipment You will need the following equipment: Arduino M0 Pro (or legacy Arduino Zero or Zero Pro, but not Arduino M0) Computer with Mynewt installed USB to Micro USB Cable Build Your Application To save time, we will simply modify the Blinky app. We'll add the Task Management code to the Blinky app. Follow the Arduino Zero Blinky tutorial to create a new project and build your bootloader and application. Finally, build and load the application to your Arduino to verify that everything is in order. Now let\u2019s get started! Create a New Task The purpose of this section is to give an introduction to the important aspects of tasks and how to properly initialize them. First, let\u2019s define a second task called work_task in main.c (located in apps/blinky/src): struct os_task work_task ; A task is represented by the os_task struct which will hold the task\u2019s information (name, state, priority, etc.). A task is made up of two main elements, a task function (also known as a task handler) and a task stack. Next, let\u2019s take a look at what is required to initialize our new task. Task Stack The task stack is an array of type os_stack_t which holds the program stack frames. Mynewt gives us the ability to set the stack size for a task giving the application developer room to optimize memory usage. Since we\u2019re not short on memory, our blinky_stack and work_stack are plenty large for the purpose of this lesson. Notice that the elements in our task stack are of type os_stack_t which are generally 32 bits, making our entire stack 1024 Bytes. #define WORK_STACK_SIZE OS_STACK_ALIGN(256) os_stack_t work_stack [ WORK_STACK_SIZE ]; Note: The OS_STACK_ALIGN macro is used to align the stack based on the hardware architecture. Task Function The task function is essentially an infinite loop which waits for some \u201cevent\u201d to wake it up. In our Blinky app the task function, named blinky_task_handler() , is initially called when we call os_start() in main() . In general, the task function is where the majority of work is done by a task. Let\u2019s write a task function for work_task called work_task_handler() : void work_task_handler ( void *arg ) { struct os_task *t ; g_led_pin = LED_BLINK_PIN ; hal_gpio_init_out ( g_led_pin , 1 ); while ( 1 ) { t = os_sched_get_current_task (); assert ( t->t_func == work_task_handler ); /* Do work... */ } } The task function is called when the task is initially put into the running state by the scheduler. We use an infinite loop to ensure that the task function never returns. Our assertion that the current task's handler is the same as our task handler is for illustration purposes only and does not need to be in most task functions. Task Priority As a preemptive, multitasking RTOS, Mynewt decides which tasks to run based on which has a higher priority; the highest priority being 0 and the lowest 255. Thus, before initializing our task, we must choose a priority defined as a macro variable. Let\u2019s set the priority of work_task to 0, because everyone knows that work is more important than blinking. #define WORK_TASK_PRIO (0) Initialization To initialize a new task we use os_task_init() which takes a number of arguments including our new task function, stack, and priority. Much like blinky_task , we\u2019re going to initialize work_task inside init_tasks to keep our main function clean. int init_tasks ( void ) { /* \u2026 */ os_task_init ( &work_task , \"work\" , work_task_handler , NULL , WORK_TASK_PRIO , OS_WAIT_FOREVER , work_stack , WORK_STACK_SIZE ); tasks_initialized = 1 ; return 0 ; } And that\u2019s it! Now run your application using the newt run command. $ newt run arduino_blinky 0.0.0 When GDB appears press C then Enter to continue and \u2026 wait, why doesn't our LED blink anymore? Review Before we run our new app, let\u2019s review what we need in order to create a task. This is a general case for a new task called mytask: 1) Define a new task, task stack, and priority: /* My Task */ struct os_task mytask /* My Task Stack */ #define MYTASK_STACK_SIZE OS_STACK_ALIGN(256) os_stack_t mytask_stack [ MYTASK_STACK_SIZE ]; /* My Task Priority */ #define MYTASK_PRIO (0) 2) Define task function: void mytask_handler ( void *arg ) { while ( 1 ) { /* ... */ } } 3) Initialize task before calling os_start() : os_task_init ( &mytask , \"mytask\" , mytask_handler , NULL , MYTASK_PRIO , OS_WAIT_FOREVER , mytask_stack , MYTASK_STACK_SIZE ); Task Priority, Preempting, and Context Switching A preemptive RTOS is one in which a higher priority task that is ready to run will preempt (i.e. take the place of) the lower priority task which is running . When a lower priority task is preempted by a higher priority task, the lower priority task\u2019s context data (stack pointer, registers, etc.) is saved and the new task is switched in. In our example, work_task has a higher priority than blinky_task and, because it is never put into a sleep state, holds the processor focus on its context. Let\u2019s give work_task a delay and some simulated work to keep it busy. Because the delay is measured in os ticks, the actual number of ticks per second is dependent on the board. Therefore, we multiply OS_TICKS_PER_SEC , which is defined in the MCU, by the number of seconds we wish to delay. void work_task_handler ( void *arg ) { struct os_task *t ; g_led_pin = LED_BLINK_PIN ; hal_gpio_init_out ( g_led_pin , 1 ); while ( 1 ) { t = os_sched_get_current_t : ask (); assert ( t->t_func == work_task_handler ); /* Do work... */ int i ; for ( i = 0 ; i < 1000000 ; ++i ) { /* Simulate doing a noticeable amount of work */ hal_gpio_set ( g_led_pin ); } os_time_delay ( 3 *OS_TICKS_PER_SECOND ); } } In order to notice the LED changing, modify the time delay in blinky_task_handler() to blink at a higher frequency. os_time_delay ( OS_TICKS_PER_SEC/ 10 ); Before we run the app, let\u2019s predict the behavior. With the newest additions to work_task_handler() , our first action will be to sleep for three seconds. This will allow blinky_task to take over the CPU and blink to its heart\u2019s content. After three seconds, work_task will wake up and be made ready to run , causing it to preempt blinky_task . The LED will then remain lit for a short period while work_task loops, then blink again for another three seconds while work_task sleeps. Voila, you should see that our prediction was correct! Priority Management Considerations When projects grow in scope, from blinking LEDs into more sophisticated applications, the number of tasks needed increases alongside complexity. It remains important, then, that each of our tasks is capable of doing its work within a reasonable amount of time. Some tasks, such as the Shell task, execute quickly and require almost instantaneous response. Therefore, the Shell task should be given a high priority. On the other hand, tasks which may be communicating over a network, or processing data, should be given a low priority in order to not hog the CPU. The diagram below showcases the different scheduling patterns we. would expect from swapping blinky and work tasks priorities. In the second case where blinky_task has a higher priority, the \u201cwork\u201d done by work_task would be executed during the millisecond delays in blinky_task , saving us idle time compared to the first case. Note: Defining the same priority for two tasks leads to somewhat undefined behavior and should be avoided. Comparing Priority Strategies Instead of stepping through a bunch of changes to our blinky app, clone my task lesson application from github and copy an existing target. Change directory into apps and clone the repository to get our new files: $ cd apps $ git clone https://github.com/bgiori/mynewt_tasks_lesson.git Change directory back to your project root and copy the arduino_blinky target to a new target called task_tgt. $ newt target copy arduino_blinky task_tgt Set a new app location. $ newt target set task_tgt app=apps/mynewt_tasks_lesson Now let\u2019s take a look at our new code. First, notice that we have abandoned blinking, instead choosing t o use the console and shell to follow our tasks through execution. Additionally, we have a number of different tasks: Task A ( a_task ): Priority : 3 \u2192 2 Description : Task A is supposed to represent a task which frequently does a small amount of work, such as one which rapidly polls a sensor for data. Much like blinky_task , Task A will loop 10,000 times then wait 1 millisecond. Priority is changed by timer_task after the first simulation. Task B ( b_task ): Priority : 2 \u2192 3 Description : Task B is supposed to represent a task which does a large amount of work relatively infrequently, such as one which sends/receives data from the cloud. Like work_task, Task B will loop 1,000,000 times then wait 3 seconds. Priority is changed by timer_task after the first simulation. Timer Task ( timer_task ): Priority : 1 Description : With default settings, Timer Task will wait 20 seconds then print the first simulations data for Task A and B. Timer task will then swap A and B\u2019s priorities and restart the simulation. After the second simulation, timer will again print simulation data then compare the two and calculate a final speedup (simulation2 / simulation1). Shell Task : Priority : 0 Description : Task used by Shell behind the scenes to communicate with the serial port. Connecting to the Serial Console Before running our new app, we must first connect to the serial console. First make sure the mynewt_arduino_zero repository is set to the develop branch. (Remove once changes have been moved to master). $ cd repos/mynewt_arduino_zero $ git checkout develop Open a new terminal window and list your serial connections to find our Arduino. $ ls /dev/tty . * /dev/tty . Bluetooth-Incoming-Port /dev/tty . usbmodem14132 In the same window, connect to the serial port using a serial communication program. In this case I\u2019ll be using mincom as it can scroll through output. $ minicom -D /dev/tty . usbmodem14132 -b 115200 If you see minicom welcome you, you\u2019re ready to move on! Output Analysis Run our new target, task_tgt, and you should see an output similar to this: Starting First Simulation... 1: Task B: 0% 78: Task B: 1% 155: Task B: 2% 257: Task B: 3% 359: Task B: 4% 461: Task B: 5% <snip> ========== Timer Expired ========== >>> Task A <<< Priority: 3 Loop count: 162849 Cycle count: 16.28 Run time: 1.40 sec >>> Task B <<< Priority: 2 Loop count: 1345852 Cycle count: 1.34 Run time: 17.0 sec Total loops: 1508709 20023: Switching priorities and restarting... 20111: Task A looped 20113: Task B: 0% 20191: Task B: 1% 20297: Task A looped 20356: Task B: 2% 20483: Task A looped 20545: Task B: 3% 20669: Task A looped 20734: Task B: 4% 20855: Task A looped 20923: Task B: 5% <snip> ========== Timer Expired ========== >>> Task A <<< Priority: 2 Loop count: 1080000 Cycle count: 108.0 Run time: 9.28 sec >>> Task B <<< Priority: 3 Loop count: 830356 Cycle count: 0.83 Run time: 10.72 sec Total loops: 1910404 40058: Final Speedup (Sim2 / Sim1): 1.26 The console output reaffirms our previous prediction and makes both the scheduling differences and subsequent efficiency boost far more apparent. Let\u2019s take a look at scheduling differences before we delve into efficiency. In the first case, where Task B\u2019s priority is higher than that of Task A, we see A get starved by Task B\u2019s long execution time. Starvation occurs when one task hogs the processor, essentially \u201cstarving\u201d other tasks which also need to run. At the end of the first 20 second simulation period, Task A has only run for 1.4 seconds compared to task B\u2019s 17 second running time \u2013 ouch. As explained before, processes which are expected to run for long periods of time (e.g. network communication, data processing) should be given higher priorities in order to combat starvation. In the second simulation with priorities swapped, we can see Task B only running during the millisecond delays when Task A is sleeping . Although having Task B only run during these delays slows its execution time, we benefit from un-starving Task A and using the processor at a higher efficiency. The bottom line speedup gives us an immediate and clear indication that we have improved our ability to process work (i.e throughput). In our second run, we processed an additional 400,000 loop iterations, equating to a 26% increase in efficiency. On a standard multi-core processor found in every modern PC, a 1.26 speedup would be an ok result to adding multithreading capabilities to a serial program. However, we accomplished this by simply setting priorities on a single core processor \u2013 not bad! NOTE: Usually the the term \u201cspeedup\u201d is used within a parallel programming context and refers to the change in execution time between a serial and parallel program executing over the same problem. In this case we\u2019re using the term loosely to illustrate the priority change\u2019s effect on scheduling and throughput in our specific context. Efficiency Isn\u2019t Everything Using the processor during every OS tick isn\u2019t always the best course of action. If we modify Task A\u2019s delay to a tenth of a millisecond and turn off the console output, we can boost our speedup to 1.44. This, however, reduces our ability to process work from Task B who ends up only completing 18% of its work cycle after the second simulation. That would mean, at that rate, Task B would take over a minute to finish one cycle. Feel free to play around with the testing parameters to study the different changes yourself! Conclusion Moving forward, tasks are just the tip of the iceberg. The scheduler , event queues , semaphores , and mutexes also add to tasks functionality, increasing our ability as the developer to control greater numbers of tasks more intricately. For example, when we switch the tasks priority, we have to tell the scheduler that our tasks priorities have changed, allowing us us to use priorities dynamically. When running multiple tasks, logging through either the built-in Logs module (not covered in this lesson) or through the serial console/shell can be very useful for debugging your application. In the end, the way you manage your tasks depends on the context of your application. You should assign priorities based on execution time, urgency, and frequency, among other things.

Introduction Writing a test suite involves using the libs/testutil package within Mynewt core os. The testutil library provides the interface to the newt command tool and also provides the compile time hooks to include test suites into your code. Review the [ testutil introduction page ] (../modules/testutil/testutil.md) to learn about how the library works. Identify Your Package Identify the package for which you are writing a test suite. For this example we will use libs/json . To create a new package, see this Tutorial . Modify Pkg.yml Edit the package ( pkg.yml ) file for your package and add the test dependency for the Mynewt core OS libs/testutil . pkg . deps . TEST : - libs/testutil Create Your Test Suite Template Create a subdirectory test under your package main directory. Create a file pair for your test code and header files within the test directory created above. Below shows the libs/json directory within the Mynewt core, including the test directory. In this example, we used the convention test_xxx.c/h (in this case test_json ). \u251c\u2500\u2500 MSJSON_COPYING \u251c\u2500\u2500 include \u2502 \u2514\u2500\u2500 json \u2502 \u2514\u2500\u2500 json . h \u251c\u2500\u2500 pkg . yml \u2514\u2500\u2500 src \u251c\u2500\u2500 json_decode . c \u251c\u2500\u2500 json_encode . c \u2514\u2500\u2500 test \u251c\u2500\u2500 test_json . c \u2514\u2500\u2500 test_json . h Create Your Test Suite Code Edit the test_json.c file and add your test suite definition. NOTE that the test suite code requires #include <testutil/testutil.h> to get the Mynewt testutil definitions. Your test suite test_json.c file contains at a minimum two functions: A test Suite which is empty for now, but will contain calls to your test cases. A main function which must be #ifdef 'd using MYNEWT_SELFTEST to ensure that is does not get compiled in when this test suite is run with test suites from other packages Below shows the contents of the test_json.c file. #include <testutil/testutil.h> TEST_SUITE ( test_json_suite ) { /* empty for now, add test cases later */ } #ifdef MYNEWT_SELFTEST int main ( int argc , char **argv ) { tu_config . tc_print_results = 1 ; tu_init (); test_json_suite (); return tu_any_failed ; } #endif Try It Out At this point, you have a working test suite with no tests. This will by default pass the test. Your output will look something like this. You can use the newt test command to run the unit tests for any package. Just include the package name. These unit tests run via the project unittest which is a native project automatically included in the core os package. Below shows some of the test output of this command. $ newt test libs/json Archiving util . a Linking test_json Testing package libs/json Test ... /bin/unittest/libs/json/test_json ok! Create a Test To create a test within your test suite, there are two things to do. Add the functions to your test suite Implement the function using the testutil macros For this tutorial we will create two functions: one to test a simple json encode and one to test the decode of this simple message to ensure its coherent. Follow These steps; 1. Create function prototypes in test_json.h for your test functions. A macro in testutil.h hides the actual prototype, but as of this writing the prototype is int test_func(void); . #ifndef TEST_JSON_H #define TEST_JSON_H TEST_CASE_DECL ( test_json_simple_encode ); TEST_CASE_DECL ( test_json_simple_decode ); #endif /* TEST_JSON_H 2. create a new file test_json_simple.c to define these two functions. For now you can stub these functions. Below shows the contents of this file. The functions are defined using macros which reference back to the testutil library so the test can be enumerated and recorded automatically. #include \"testutil/testutil.h\" #include \"test_json.h\" TEST_CASE ( test_json_simple_encode ) { } TEST_CASE ( test_json_simple_decode ) { } #endif /* TEST_JSON_H 3. Add the tests to your test suite in test_json.c as shown below. TEST_SUITE ( test_json_suite ) { test_json_simple_encode (); test_json_simple_decode (); } Your test suite should still pass as shown below $newt test libs/json Testing package libs/json Test ... /bin/unittest/libs/json/test_json ok! Add Contents to your Tests At this point, you can add contents to your test and verify that the test suites pass. For now, lets just add a simple failure to show what it would look like when running from Newt. Edit test_json_simple.c and add a TEST_ASSERT to a test function. The test assert will fail if its argument is false . TEST_CASE ( test_json_simple_encode ) { TEST_ASSERT ( 0 ); } When running newt, you will see the test suite fails with something like the message shown below. Testing package libs/json [ FAIL ] test_json_suite/ ( null ) |test_json_simple . c : 24 | failed assertion : 0 Error : Test crashed : .. /bin/unittest/libs/json/test_json exit status 1 Congratulations Now you can begin the work of adding your test cases and test.

Note: Wi-Fi support is currently available in the develop branch of Mynewt only. It will be merged into master branch when version 0.10 is released. Prerequisites Before tackling this tutorial, it's best to read about Mynewt in the Introduction section of this documentation. Equipment You will need the following equipment An Arduino Zero, Zero Pro or M0 Pro. Note: Mynewt has not been tested on Arduino M0 which has no internal debugger support. An Arduino Wi-Fi Shield 101 A computer that can connect to the Arduino board over USB A local Wi-Fi network that the computer is connected to and which the Arduino board can join. A USB cable (Type A to micro B) that can connect the computer to the Arduino (or a USB hub between the computer and the Arduino board) The Mynewt Release Install Mynewt and Newt If you have not already done so, install Newt as shown in the Newt install tutorial . If you installed Newt previously but need to update it, go to the newt git repo directory, pull the latest code from develop branch, and install the updated code. user@~/dev$ cd $GOPATH/src/mynewt.apache.org/newt user@~/dev/go/src/mynewt.apache.org/newt$ git remote -v origin https://git-wip-us.apache.org/repos/asf/incubator-mynewt-newt.git (fetch) origin https://git-wip-us.apache.org/repos/asf/incubator-mynewt-newt.git (push) user@~/dev/go/src/mynewt.apache.org/newt$ git pull origin develop remote: Counting objects: 59, done. <snip> user@~/dev/go/src/mynewt.apache.org/newt$ cd newt user@~/dev/go/src/mynewt.apache.org/newt/newt$ go install user@~/dev$ cd ~/dev If you have not already done so, create a project as shown in the Quick Start guide on how to Create Your First Project . Skip the testing and building the project steps in that tutorial since you will be defining a target for your Arduino board in this tutorial. Let's say your new project is named arduinowifi . You will henceforth be working in that project directory. Fetch External Packages, Set correct version to download Mynewt uses source code provided directly from the chip manufacturer for low level operations. Sometimes this code is licensed only for the specific manufacturer of the chipset and cannot live in the Apache Mynewt repository. That happens to be the case for the Arduino Zero board which uses Atmel SAMD21. Runtime's github repository hosts such external third-party packages and the Newt tool can fetch them. To fetch the package with MCU support for Atmel SAMD21 for Arduino Zero from the Runtime git repository, you need to add the repository to the project.yml file in your base project directory ( arduinowifi ). user@~/dev/arduinowifi$ vi project.yml Here is an example project.yml file with the Arduino Zero repository added. The sections with mynewt_arduino_zero that need to be added to your project file are highlighted. Also highlighted is the 0-dev version for both the repositories to ensure code is downloaded from the develop branch. $ more project.yml project.name: \"my_project\" project.repositories: - apache-mynewt-core - mynewt_arduino_zero repository.apache-mynewt-core: type: github vers: 0-dev user: apache repo: incubator-mynewt-core repository.mynewt_arduino_zero: type: github vers: 0-dev user: runtimeinc repo: mynewt_arduino_zero $ Once you've edited your project.yml file, the next step is to install the project dependencies, this can be done with the newt install command (to see more output, provide the -v verbose option.): $ newt install apache-mynewt-core mynewt_arduino_zero $ Create your bootloader target Next, you need to tell Newt what to build. For the Arduino Zero, we are going to generate both a bootloader, and an image target. To generate the bootloader target, you need to specify the following options. The output of the commands (indicating success) have been suppressed for easier readability. $ newt target create arduino_boot $ newt target set arduino_boot bsp=@mynewt_arduino_zero/hw/bsp/arduino_zero $ newt target set arduino_boot app=@apache-mynewt-core/apps/boot $ newt target set arduino_boot build_profile=optimized If you have an Arduino Zero Pro or M0 Pro, you have to set the following next: $ newt target set arduino_boot features=arduino_zero_pro If you have an Arduino Zero, you have to set the following instead: $ newt target set arduino_boot features=arduino_zero Build your bootloader Once you've configured the bootloader target, the next step is to build the bootloader for your Arduino. You can do this by using the newt build command: $ newt build arduino_boot Compiling boot.c Archiving boot.a Compiling fs_cli.c Compiling fs_dirent.c Compiling fs_file.c Compiling fs_mkdir.c <snip> App successfully built: ~/dev/arduinowifi/bin/arduino_boot/apps/boot/boot.elf If this command finishes successfully, you have successfully built the Arduino bootloader, and the next step is to build your application for the Arduino board. Build your blinky app To create and download your application, you create another target, this one pointing to the application you want to download to the Arduino board. In this tutorial, we will use the Wi-Fi application that comes in the arduino repository, apps/winc1500_wifi : Note : Remember to set features to arduino_zero if your board is Arduino Zero and not a Pro! $ newt target create arduino_wifi $ newt target set arduino_wifi app=@mynewt_arduino_zero/apps/winc1500_wifi $ newt target set arduino_wifi bsp=@mynewt_arduino_zero/hw/bsp/arduino_zero $ newt target set arduino_wifi build_profile=debug $ newt target set arduino_wifi features=arduino_zero_pro You can now build the target, with newt build : $ newt build arduino_wifi Building target targets/arduino_wifi Compiling main.c Archiving winc1500_wifi.a Compiling fs_cli.c Compiling fs_dirent.c Compiling fs_file.c Compiling fs_mkdir.c <snip> Linking winc1500_wifi.elf App successfully built: ~/dev/arduinowifi/bin/arduino_wifi/apps/winc1500_wifi/winc1500_wifi.elf Congratulations! You have successfully built your Wi-Fi application. Now it's time to load both the bootloader and application onto the target. Connect the Target Place the Wi-Fi shield on top of the Arduino board and push it in place, making sure the pins and pinholes are properly aligned. Connect your computer to the Arduino board with the Micro-USB cable through the Programming Port as shown below. Mynewt will download and debug the target through this port. You should see a little green LED come on. That means the board has power. No external debugger is required. The Arduino boards listed in this tutorial come with an internal debugger that can be accessed by Mynewt. The picture below shows the setup. Download the Bootloader Execute the command to download the bootloader. $ newt load arduino_boot If the newt tool finishes without error, that means the bootloader has been successfully loaded onto the target. Reminder if you are using Docker: When working with actual hardware, remember that each board has an ID. If you swap boards and do not refresh the USB Device Filter on the VirtualBox UI, the ID might be stale and the Docker instance may not be able to see the board correctly. For example, you may see an error message like Error: unable to find CMSIS-DAP device when you try to load or run an image on the board. In that case, you need to click on the USB link in VirtualBox UI, remove the existing USB Device Filter (e.g. \"Atmel Corp. EDBG CMSIS-DAP[0101]\") by clicking on the \"Removes selected USB filter\" button, and add a new filter by clicking on the \"Adds new USB filter\" button. Load the Application Image Now that the bootloader is downloaded to the target, the next steps are to create an image and load it onto the target device. $ newt create-image arduino_wifi 1.0.0 App image succesfully generated: ~/dev/arduinowifi/bin/arduino_wifi/apps/winc1500_wifi/winc1500_wifi.img Build manifest: ~/dev/arduinowifi/bin/arduino_wifi/apps/winc1500_wifi/manifest.json $ newt load arduino_wifi Loading image $ Start Wi-Fi via console Use a terminal emulation program to communicate with the board over the serial port.

An advertisement typically contains additional information about the peripheral sending it, such as the device name and an abbreviated list of supported services. The presence of this information helps a listening central to determine whether it is interested in connecting to the peripheral. Advertisements are quite limited in the amount of information they can contain, so only the most important information should be included. When a listening device receives an advertisement, it can choose to connect to the peripheral, or query the sender for more information. This second action is known as an active scan . A peripheral responds to an active scan with some extra information that it couldn't fit in its advertisement. This additional information is known as scan response data . bleprph does not configure any scan response data, so this feature is not discussed in the remainder of this tutorial. bleprph constantly broadcasts advertisements until a central connects to it. When a connection is terminated, bleprph resumes advertising. Let's take a look at bleprph 's advertisement code ( main.c ): /** * Enables advertising with the following parameters: * o General discoverable mode. * o Undirected connectable mode. */ static void bleprph_advertise ( void ) { struct ble_hs_adv_fields fields ; int rc ; /* Set the advertisement data included in our advertisements. */ memset ( &fields , 0 , sizeof fields ); fields . name = ( uint8_t * ) bleprph_device_name ; fields . name_len = strlen ( bleprph_device_name ); fields . name_is_complete = 1 ; rc = ble_gap_adv_set_fields ( &fields ); if ( rc != 0 ) { BLEPRPH_LOG ( ERROR , \"error setting advertisement data; rc=%d\\n\" , rc ); return ; } /* Begin advertising. */ rc = ble_gap_adv_start ( BLE_GAP_DISC_MODE_GEN , BLE_GAP_CONN_MODE_UND , NULL , 0 , NULL , bleprph_on_connect , NULL ); if ( rc != 0 ) { BLEPRPH_LOG ( ERROR , \"error enabling advertisement; rc=%d\\n\" , rc ); return ; } } Now let's examine this code in detail. Setting advertisement data A NimBLE peripheral specifies what information to include in its advertisements with the following function: int ble_gap_adv_set_fields ( struct ble_hs_adv_fields *adv_fields ) The adv_fields argument specifies the fields and their contents to include in subsequent advertisements. The Bluetooth Core Specification Supplement defines a set of standard fields that can be included in an advertisement; the member variables of the struct ble_hs_adv_fields type correspond to these standard fields. Information that doesn't fit neatly into a standard field should be put in the manufacturing specific data field. As you can see in the above code listing, the struct ble_hs_adv_fields instance is allocated on the stack. It is OK to use the stack for this struct and the data it references, as the ble_gap_adv_set_fields() function makes a copy of all the advertisement data before it returns. bleprph doesn't take full advantange of this; it stores its device name in a static array. The code sets three members of the struct ble_hs_adv_fields instance: name name_len name_is_complete The first two fields are used to communicate the device's name and are quite straight-forward. The third field requires some explanation. Bluetooth specifies two name-related advertisement fields: Shortened Local Name and Complete Local Name . Setting the name_is_complete variable to 1 or 0 tells NimBLE which of these two fields to include in advertisements. Some other advertisement fields also correspond to multiple variables in the field struct, so it is a good idea to review the ble_hs_adv_fields reference to make sure you get the details right in your app. Begin advertising An app starts advertising with the following function: int ble_gap_adv_start ( uint8_t discoverable_mode , uint8_t connectable_mode , uint8_t *peer_addr , uint8_t peer_addr_type , struct hci_adv_params *adv_params , ble_gap_conn_fn *cb , void *cb_arg ) This function allows a lot of flexibility, and it might seem daunting at first glance. bleprph specifies a simple set of arguments that is appropriate for most peripherals. When getting started on a typical peripheral, we recommend you use the same arguments as bleprph , with the exception of the last two ( cb and cb_arg ). These last two arguments will be specific to your app, so let's talk about them. cb is a callback function. It gets executed when a central connects to your peripheral after receiving an advertisement. The cb_arg argument gets passed to the cb callback. If your callback doesn't need the cb_arg parameter, you can do what bleprph does and pass NULL . Once a connection is established, the cb callback becomes permanently associated with the connection. All subsequent events related to the connection are communicated to your app via calls to this callback function. Connection callbacks are an important part of building a BLE app, and we examine bleprph 's connection callback in detail in the next section of this tutorial. One final note: Your peripheral automatically stops advertising when a central connects to it. You can immediately resume advertising if you want to allow another central to connect, but you will need to do so explicitly by calling ble_gap_adv_start() again. Also, be aware NimBLE's default configuration only allows a single connection at a time.

Recall that services and characteristics are registered with NimBLE via attribute tables. Each characteristic definition in an attribute table contains an access_cb field. The access_cb field is an application callback that gets executed whenever a peer device attempts to read or write the characteristic. Earlier in this tutorial, we looked at how bleprph implements the GAP service. Let's take another look at how bleprph specifies the first few characteristics in this service. static const struct ble_gatt_svc_def gatt_svr_svcs [] = { { /*** Service: GAP. */ . type = BLE_GATT_SVC_TYPE_PRIMARY , . uuid128 = BLE_UUID16 ( BLE_GAP_SVC_UUID16 ), . characteristics = ( struct ble_gatt_chr_def []) { { /*** Characteristic: Device Name. */ . uuid128 = BLE_UUID16 ( BLE_GAP_CHR_UUID16_DEVICE_NAME ), . access_cb = gatt_svr_chr_access_gap , . flags = BLE_GATT_CHR_F_READ , }, { /*** Characteristic: Appearance. */ . uuid128 = BLE_UUID16 ( BLE_GAP_CHR_UUID16_APPEARANCE ), . access_cb = gatt_svr_chr_access_gap , . flags = BLE_GATT_CHR_F_READ , }, { // [...] As you can see, bleprph uses the same access_cb function for all the GAP service characteristics, but the developer could have implemented separate functions for each characteristic if they preferred.

Function signature static int gatt_svr_chr_access_gap ( uint16_t conn_handle , uint16_t attr_handle , uint8_t op , union ble_gatt_access_ctxt *ctxt , void *arg ) A characteristic access function always takes this same set of parameters and always returns an int. The parameters to this function type are documented below. Parameter Purpose Notes conn_handle Indicates which connection the characteristic access was sent over. Use this value to determine which peer is accessing the characteristic. attr_handle The low-level ATT handle of the characteristic value attribute. Can be used to determine which characteristic is being accessed if you don't want to perform a UUID lookup. op Indicates whether this is a read or write operation Valid values are: BLE_GATT_ACCESS_OP_READ_CHR BLE_GATT_ACCESS_OP_WRITE_CHR ctxt Contains the characteristic value pointer that the application needs to access. For characteristic accesses, use the ctxt->chr_access member; for descriptor accesses, use the ctxt->dsc_access member. The return value of the access function tells the NimBLE stack how to respond to the peer performing the operation. A value of 0 indicates success. For failures, the function returns the specific ATT error code that the NimBLE stack should respond with. The ATT error codes are defined in net/nimble/host/include/host/ble_att.h . Determine characteristic being accessed { uint16_t uuid16 ; uuid16 = ble_uuid_128_to_16 ( ctxt->chr_access . chr->uuid128 ); assert ( uuid16 != 0 ); switch ( uuid16 ) { // [...] This function uses the UUID to determine which characteristic is being accessed. There are two alternative methods bleprph could have used to accomplish this task: Map characteristics to ATT handles during service registration; use the attr_handle parameter as a key into this table during characteristic access. Implement a dedicated function for each characteristic; each function inherently knows which characteristic it corresponds to. All the GAP service characteristics have 16-bit UUIDs, so this function uses the ble_uuid_128_to_16() function to convert the 128-bit UUID to its corresponding 16-bit UUID. This conversion function returns the corresponding 16-bit UUID on success, or 0 on failure. Success is asserted here to ensure the NimBLE stack is doing its job properly; the stack should only call this function for accesses to characteristics that it is registered with, and all GAP service characteristics have valid 16-bit UUIDs. Read access case BLE_GAP_CHR_UUID16_DEVICE_NAME : assert ( op == BLE_GATT_ACCESS_OP_READ_CHR ); ctxt->chr_access . data = ( void * ) bleprph_device_name ; ctxt->chr_access . len = strlen ( bleprph_device_name ); break ; This code excerpt handles read accesses to the device name characteristic. The assert() here is another case of making sure the NimBLE stack is doing its job; this characteristic was registered as read-only, so the stack should have prevented write accesses. To fulfill a characteristic read request, the application needs to assign the ctxt->chr_access.data field to point to the attribute data to respond with, and fill the ctxt->chr_access.len field with the length of the attribute data. bleprph stores the device name in read-only memory as follows: const char *bleprph_device_name = \"nimble-bleprph\" ; The cast to pointer-to-void is a necessary annoyance to remove the const qualifier from the device name variable. You will need to \"cast away const\" whenever you respond to read requests with read-only data. It is not shown in the above snippet, but this function ultimately returns 0. By returning 0, bleprph indicates that the characteristic data in ctxt->chr_access is valid and that NimBLE should include it in its response to the peer. A word of warning: The attribute data that ctxt->chr_access.data points to must remain valid after the access function returns, as the NimBLE stack needs to use it to form a GATT read response. In other words, you must not allocate the characteristic value data on the stack of the access function. Two characteristic accesses never occur at the same time, so it is OK to use the same memory for repeated accesses. Write access case BLE_GAP_CHR_UUID16_RECONNECT_ADDR : assert ( op == BLE_GATT_ACCESS_OP_WRITE_CHR ); if ( ctxt->chr_access . len != sizeof bleprph_reconnect_addr ) { return BLE_ATT_ERR_INVALID_ATTR_VALUE_LEN ; } memcpy ( bleprph_reconnect_addr , ctxt->chr_access . data , sizeof bleprph_reconnect_addr ); break ; This code excerpt handles writes to the reconnect address characteristic. This characteristic was registered as write-only, so the assert() here is just a safety precaution to ensure the NimBLE stack is doing its job. For writes, the roles of the ctxt->chr_access.data and ctxt->chr_access.len fields are the reverse of the read case. The NimBLE stack uses these fields to indicate the data written by the peer. Many characteristics have strict length requirements for write operations. This characteristic has such a restriction; if the written data is not a 48-bit BR address, the application tells NimBLE to respond with an invalid attribute value length error. For writes, the ctxt->chr_access.data pointer is only valid for the duration of the access function. If the application needs to save the written data, it should store it elsewhere before the function returns. In this case, bleprph stores the specified address in a global variable called bleprph_reconnect_addr .","title":"Characteristic Access"},{"location":"os/tutorials/bleprph/bleprph-chr-access/#ble-peripheral-project","text":"","title":"BLE Peripheral Project"},{"location":"os/tutorials/bleprph/bleprph-chr-access/#characteristic-access","text":"","title":"Characteristic Access"},{"location":"os/tutorials/bleprph/bleprph-chr-access/#review","text":"A characteristic's access callback implements its behavior.

For characteristic accesses, use the ctxt->chr_access member; for descriptor accesses, use the ctxt->dsc_access member. The return value of the access function tells the NimBLE stack how to respond to the peer performing the operation. A value of 0 indicates success. For failures, the function returns the specific ATT error code that the NimBLE stack should respond with.

There are two alternative methods bleprph could have used to accomplish this task: Map characteristics to ATT handles during service registration; use the attr_handle parameter as a key into this table during characteristic access. Implement a dedicated function for each characteristic; each function inherently knows which characteristic it corresponds to. All the GAP service characteristics have 16-bit UUIDs, so this function uses the ble_uuid_128_to_16() function to convert the 128-bit UUID to its corresponding 16-bit UUID. This conversion function returns the corresponding 16-bit UUID on success, or 0 on failure. Success is asserted here to ensure the NimBLE stack is doing its job properly; the stack should only call this function for accesses to characteristics that it is registered with, and all GAP service characteristics have valid 16-bit UUIDs.","title":"Determine characteristic being accessed"},{"location":"os/tutorials/bleprph/bleprph-chr-access/#read-access","text":"case BLE_GAP_CHR_UUID16_DEVICE_NAME : assert ( op == BLE_GATT_ACCESS_OP_READ_CHR ); ctxt->chr_access . data = ( void * ) bleprph_device_name ; ctxt->chr_access . len = strlen ( bleprph_device_name ); break ; This code excerpt handles read accesses to the device name characteristic. The assert() here is another case of making sure the NimBLE stack is doing its job; this characteristic was registered as read-only, so the stack should have prevented write accesses. To fulfill a characteristic read request, the application needs to assign the ctxt->chr_access.data field to point to the attribute data to respond with, and fill the ctxt->chr_access.len field with the length of the attribute data. bleprph stores the device name in read-only memory as follows: const char *bleprph_device_name = \"nimble-bleprph\" ; The cast to pointer-to-void is a necessary annoyance to remove the const qualifier from the device name variable. You will need to \"cast away const\" whenever you respond to read requests with read-only data. It is not shown in the above snippet, but this function ultimately returns 0. By returning 0, bleprph indicates that the characteristic data in ctxt->chr_access is valid and that NimBLE should include it in its response to the peer. A word of warning: The attribute data that ctxt->chr_access.data points to must remain valid after the access function returns, as the NimBLE stack needs to use it to form a GATT read response. In other words, you must not allocate the characteristic value data on the stack of the access function.

Many characteristics have strict length requirements for write operations.

A connection callback is a bit of application code which NimBLE uses to inform you of connection-related events. For example, if a connection is terminated, NimBLE lets you know about it with a call to that connection's callback. In the advertising section of this tutorial, we saw how the application specifies a connection callback when it begins advertising. NimBLE uses this callback to notify the application that a central has connected to your peripheral after receiving an advertisement. Let's revisit how bleprph specifies its connection callback when advertising: /* Begin advertising. */ rc = ble_gap_adv_start ( BLE_GAP_DISC_MODE_GEN , BLE_GAP_CONN_MODE_UND , NULL , 0 , NULL , bleprph_on_connect , NULL ); if ( rc != 0 ) { BLEPRPH_LOG ( ERROR , \"error enabling advertisement; rc=%d\\n\" , rc ); return ; } bleprph_on_connect() The bleprph_on_connect() function is bleprph 's connection callback; NimBLE calls this function when the advertising operation leads to connection establishment. Upon connecting, this callback becomes permanently associated with the connection; all subsequent events related to this connection are communicated through this callback. Now let's look at the function that bleprph uses for all its connection callbacks: bleprph_on_connect() . static int bleprph_on_connect ( int event , int status , struct ble_gap_conn_ctxt *ctxt , void *arg ) { switch ( event ) { case BLE_GAP_EVENT_CONN : BLEPRPH_LOG ( INFO , \"connection %s; status=%d \" , status == 0 ? \"up\" : \"down\" , status ); bleprph_print_conn_desc ( ctxt->desc ); BLEPRPH_LOG ( INFO , \"\\n\" ); if ( status != 0 ) { /* Connection terminated; resume advertising. */ bleprph_advertise (); } break ; } return 0 ; } Connection callbacks are used to communicate a variety of events related to a connection. An application determines the type of event that occurred by inspecting the value of the event parameter. The full list of event codes can be found in net/nimble/host/include/host/ble_gatt.h . bleprph only concerns itself with a single event type: BLE_GAP_EVENT_CONN . This event indicates that a new connection has been established, or an existing connection has been terminated; the status parameter clarifies which. As you can see, bleprph uses the status parameter to determine if it should resume advertising. The ctxt parameter contains additional information about the connection event. bleprph does nothing more than log some fields of this struct, but some apps will likely want to perform further actions, e.g., perform service discovery on the connected device.

For events of type BLE_GAP_EVENT_CONN , the anonymous union is not used at all, so the only information carried by the context struct is the connection descriptor. The struct ble_gap_conn_desc type is defined as follows: struct ble_gap_conn_desc { uint8_t peer_addr [ 6 ]; uint16_t conn_handle ; uint16_t conn_itvl ; uint16_t conn_latency ; uint16_t supervision_timeout ; uint8_t peer_addr_type ; }; We will examine these fields in a slightly different order from how they appear in the struct definition.

Multiple tables can be used if it is impractical for the entire attribute set to live in one place in your code. bleprph uses a single attribute table located in the gatt_svr.c file, so let's take a look at that now.

What differentiates a repository from a Mynewt project is the presence of a repository.yml file describing the repository. This will be described below. For a basic understanding of repositories you may read the Newt Tool Manual and How to create repos . Note: For the remainder of this document we'll use the term repo as shorthand for a Mynewt repository. Repos are useful because they are an organized way for the community to share Mynewt packages and projects. In fact, the Mynewt-core is distributed as a repo. Why does Mynewt need additional repos? Repos add functionality not included in the Mynewt core. New repos might be created for several reasons. Expertise . Individuals or organizations may have expertise that they want to share in the form of repos. For example a chip vendor may create a repo to hold the Mynewt support for their chips. Non-Core component . Some components, although very useful to Mynewt users are not core to all Mynewt users. These are likely candidates to be held in different repos. Software licensing . Some software have licenses that make them incompatible with the ASF (Apache Software Foundation) license policies. These may be valuable components to some Mynewt users, but cannot be contained in the apache-Mynewt-core . What Repos are in my Project The list of repos used by your project are contained within the project.yml file. An example can be seen by creating a new project: $ mkdir ~/dev $ cd ~/dev $ newt new myproj $ cd myproj View the project.yml section and you will see a line describing the repos: project.repositories: - apache-Mynewt-core By default, this newly created project uses a single repo called apache-Mynewt-core . If you wish to add additional repos, you would add additional lines to the project.repositories variable like this. project.repositories: - apache-Mynewt-core - another_repo_named_x Repo Descriptors In addition to the repo name, the project.yml file must also contain a repo descriptor for each repository you include that gives newt information on obtaining the repo. In the same myproj above you will see the following repo descriptor. repository.apache-Mynewt-core: type: github vers: 0-latest user: apache repo: incubator-mynewt-core A repo descriptor starts with repository.<name>. . In this example, the descriptor specifies the information for the apache-Mynewt-core . The fields within the descriptor have the following definitions: type -- The type of code storage the repo uses. The current version of newt only supports github. Future versions may support generic git or other code storage mechanisms. vers -- The version of the repo to use for your project. A source code repository contains many versions of the source. This field is used to specify the one to use for this project. See the section on versions below for a detailed description of the format of this field. user -- The username for the repo. On github, this is the name after github.com in the repo path. Consider the repository https://github.com/apache/incubator-mynewt-core . It has username apache . repo -- The name of the repo. On github, this is the name after the username described above. Consider the repository https://github.com/apache/incubator-mynewt-core . It has username incubator-mynewt-core . This is a path to the source control and should not be confused with the name of the repo that you used in the repository.<name> declaration above. That name is contained elsewhere within the repo. See Below. Adding Existing Repos to my Project To add a new repo to your project, you have to complete two steps. Edit the project.yml file and add a new repo descriptor. The previous section includes information on the field required in your repo descriptor. Edit the project/yml file and add a new line to the project.repositories variable with the name of the repo you are adding. An example of a project.yml file with two repositories is shown below: project.name: \"my_project\" project.repositories: - apache-Mynewt-core - Mynewt_arduino_zero # Use github's distribution mechanism for core ASF libraries. # This provides mirroring automatically for us. # repository.apache-Mynewt-core: type: github vers: 0-latest user: apache repo: incubator-mynewt-core # a special repo to hold hardware specific stuff for arduino zero repository.Mynewt_arduino_zero: type: github vers: 0-latest user: runtimeinc repo: Mynewt_arduino_zero What Version of the Repo to use Mynewt repos are version-ed artifacts. They are stored in source control systems like github. The repo descriptor in your project.yml file must specify the version of the repo you will accept into your project. For now, we are at the beginnings of Mynewt. For testing and evaluation please use 0-latest in the vers field in your repo descriptor. vers:0-latest See Create a Repo for a description of the versioning system and all the possible ways to specify a version to use. Identifying a Repo A repo contains Mynewt packages organized in a specific way and stored in one of the supported code storage methods described above. In other words, it is a Mynewt project with an additional file repository.yml which describes the repo for use by newt (and humans browsing them). It contains a mapping of version numbers to the actual github branches containing the source code. Note that the repository.yml file lives only in the master branch of the git repository. Newt will always fetch this file from the master branch and then use that to determine the actual branch required depending on the version specified in your project.yml file. Special care should be taken to ensure that this file exists only in the master branch. Here is the repository.yml file from the apache-Mynewt-core: repo.name: apache-mynewt-core repo.versions: \"0.7.9\": \"Mynewt_0_8_0_b2_tag\" \"0-latest\": \"0.7.9\" \"0.8-latest\": \"0.7.9\" It contains the following: repo.name The external name that is used to include the library in your project.yml file. This is the name you in include in the project.repositories variable when adding this repository to your project. repo.versions A description of what versions to give the user depending on the settings in their project.yml file. Repo Version The repo version number resolves to an actual git branch depending on the mapping specified in repository.yml for that repo. The version field argument in your project.yml file supports multiple formats for flexibility: <major_num>.<minor_num>.<revision_num> or <major_num>.<minor_num>-<stability string> or <major_num>-<stability string> The stability string can be one of 3 pre-defined stability values. stable -- A stable release version of the repository dev -- A development version from the repository latest -- The latest from the repository In your project.yml file you can specify different combinations of the version number and stability value. For example: 0-latest -- The latest version with major number 0 1.2-stable -- The latest stable version with major and minor number 1.2 1.2-dev -- The development version from 1.2 1.1.1 -- a specific version 1.1.1 You cannot specify a stability string with a fully numbered version, e.g. 1.2.8-stable Repo Versions Available A repository.yml file contains information to match a version request into a git branch to fetch for your project. It's up to the repository maintainer to map these to branches of the repository. For example, let's say in a fictitious repository the following are defined. repo.versions: \"0.8.0\": \"xxx_branch_0_8_0\" \"1.0.0\": \"xxx_branch_1_0_0\" \"1.0.2\": \"xxx_branch_1_0_2\" \"1.1.1\": \"xxx_branch_1_1_0\" \"1.1.2\": \"xxx_branch_1_1_2\" \"1.2.0\": \"xxx_branch_1_2_0\" \"1.2.1\": \"xxx_branch_1_2_1\" \"1.2-dev\": \"1.2.1\" \"1-dev\": \"1.2-dev\" \"1.2-stable\": \"1.2.0\" \"0-latest\": \"0.8.0\" \"1-latest\": \"1-dev\" .... When the project.yml file asks for 1.2-stable it is resolved to version 1.2.0 (perhaps 1.2.1 is not stable yet), which in turn resolves to a specific branch xxx_branch_1_2_0 . This is the branch that newt fetches into your project. Note: Make sure a repo version exists in the repository.yml file of a repo you wish to add. Otherwise Newt will not be able to resolve the version and will fail to fetch the repo into your project. How to find out what Repos are available for Mynewt components Currently, there is no newt command to locate/search Mynewt package repositories. However, since the newt tool supports only github, searching github by keyword is a satisfactory option until a search tool is created. When searching github, recall that a Mynewt repository must have a repository.yml file in its root directory. If you don't see that file, it's not a Mynewt repository and can't be included in your project via the newt tool. Once you find a repository, the github URL and repository.yml file should give you all the information to add it to your project.yml file.","title":"toc"},{"location":"os/tutorials/repo/add_repos/#adding-repositories-to-your-project","text":"","title":"Adding Repositories to your Project"},{"location":"os/tutorials/repo/add_repos/#what-is-a-repository","text":"A repository is a version-ed Mynewt project, which is a collection of Mynewt packages organized in a specific way for redistribution.

This is the branch that newt will fetch into the project with that project.yml file. Dependencies on other repos Repositories can also have dependencies on other repositories. These dependencies should be listed out on a per-tag basis. So, for example, if apache-mynewt-core were to depend on sterlys-little-repo, you might have the following directives in the repository.yml: develop.repositories: sterlys-little-repo: type: github vers: 0.8-latest user: sterlinghughes repo: sterlys-little-repo This would tell Newt that for anything that resolves to the develop branch, this repository requires the sterlys-little-repo repository. Dependencies are resolved circularly by the newt tool, and every dependent repository is placed as a sibling in the repos directory. Currently, if two repositories have the same name, they will conflict and bad things will happen. When a repository is installed to the repos/ directory, the current version of that repository is written to the \"project.state\" file.
