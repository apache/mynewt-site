Newt Manager Guide
------------------

Newt Manager (newtmgr) is the application tool that enables a user to
communicate with and manage remote devices running the Mynewt OS. It
uses a connection profile to establish a connection with a device and
sends command requests to the device. The tool follows the same command
structure as the :doc:`newt tool <../newt/index>`.
