This guide shows you how to install Go and setup your environment to update and build the tools if you want to: Contribute to newt or newtmgr features or fix bugs. Build the tools with latest updates from the master branch on a Linux platform. This guide shows you how to perform the following: Install Go on either Mac OS X or Linux. (Tasks that are specific to each platform are called out.) Setup the Go environment. Download the source, build, and install the newt or newtmgr tools. Update and rebuild the tools. Note: You will also need to read and follow the instructions from the FAQ to set up your git repos to submit changes. Step 1: Installing Go The latest master branch of newt and newtmgr requires GO version 1.6 or higher. You can skip this step and proceed to Step 2 if you already have Go version 1.6 or higher installed. Installing Go on Mac OS X If you do not have Homebrew installed, run the following command. You will be prompted for your sudo password. $ ruby -e \"$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)\" You can also extract (or git clone ) Homebrew and install it to /usr/local.

Setting up golang (2:1.6.1+1ubuntu2) ... $ go version go version go1.6.3 linux/amd64 Step 2: Setting Up Your Go Environment This section describes the Go environment and how to setup a Go workspace. If you already have a Go workspace for your other Go projects, you can skip this step and proceed to Step 3. Go provides an environment to compile Go code, construct Go packages, and import Go code. You will use Go commands to import the newt or newtmgr package repository into your local Go environment. The Go language environment dictates a specific directory structure, or workspace in Go parlance. It must contain three sibling directories with the names src , pkg and bin : src contains Go source files organized into packages (one package per directory) pkg contains package objects bin contains the Go application executables that Go builds and installs. The GOPATH environment variable specifies the location of your workspace. To setup this workspace environment, create a dev directory and then a go directory under it. Set the GOPATH environment variable to this directory where you will clone the newt and newtmgr repositories. $ cd $HOME $ mkdir -p dev/go $ cd dev/go $ export GOPATH=`pwd` Add the following export statements to your ~/.bash_profile file and source the file: export GOPATH=$HOME/dev/go export PATH=$GOPATH/bin:$PATH Step 3: Downloading the Source and Installing the Tools Newt and newtmgr are individual Go packages and have their own git repositories. You can download the source and install one or both tools. We use the go get command to download the source, build, and install the binary in the $GOPATH/bin directory. Downloading and Installing the Newt Tool The newt Go package is mynewt.apache.org/newt/newt and is stored in the Apache Mynewt newt tool repository mirrored on github . Download the newt package source and install the tool: $cd $GOPATH $go get mynewt.apache.org/newt/newt $cd $GOPATH/src/mynewt.apache.org/newt $ls DISCLAIMER RELEASE_NOTES.md util INSTALLING.md build.sh viper LICENSE newt yaml NOTICE newtmgr README.md newtvm $git status On branch master Your branch is up-to-date with 'origin/master'. nothing to commit, working directory clean Note: The source code under the newtmgr directory is no longer used or updated. The current newtmgr source has its own Git repository. Check that the newt binary is installed and you are using the one from $GOPATH/bin : $ls $GOPATH/bin/newt ~/dev/go/bin/newt $which newt ~/dev/go/bin/newt $newt version Apache Newt (incubating) version: 1.0.0-dev Downloading and Installing the Newtmgr Tool The newtmgr Go package is mynewt.apache.org/newtmgr/newtmgr . It is stored in the Apache Mynewt newtmgr tool repository mirrored on github . Download the newtmgr package and install the tool: Note: -ldflags -s must be passed to the go get command. $cd $GOPATH $go get -ldflags -s mynewt.apache.org/newtmgr/newtmgr $cd $GOPATH/src/mynewt.apache.org/newtmgr $ls DISCLAIMER NOTICE newtmgr LICENSE README.md nmxact $git status On branch master Your branch is up-to-date with 'origin/master'. nothing to commit, working directory clean Check that the newtmgr binary is installed and you are using the one from $GOPATH/bin : $ls $GOPATH/bin/newtmgr ~/dev/go/bin/newtmgr $which newtmgr ~/dev/go/bin/newtmgr Step 4: Updating and Rebuilding the Tools: This section shows you how to rebuild the newt and newtmgr tools with the latest updates from the master branch or after you have made changes in your branch. Here is the general procedure to rebuild either the newt or newtmgr tool. The only difference is the directory where you will be executing the commands from. You will need to repeat the procedure to rebuild both tools. Change to the directory where the local Git repository for the tool is installed. Pull the latest changes from the master branch. If you made changes you will need to rebase with origin master (See FAQ ). Build and install the tool. Change to the directory where the source for the tool is installed. For the newt tool: $cd $GOPATH/src/mynewt.apache.org/newt/newt For the newtmgr tool: $cd $GOPATH/src/mynewt.apache.org/newtmgr/newtmgr After you change to the specific tool directory, get the latest updates from the master branch. If you made changes and need to rebase with the origin, add the --rebase origin master arguments to the git pull command: $git pull Build and install the tool. The updated binary will be installed in the $GOPATH/bin directory: ( Note: -ldflags -s must be passed to the go install command if you are rebuilding newtmgr) $go install You can run the ls -l command to check the modification time for the binary to ensure the new version is installed.","title":"Setting Up Go to Contribute to Newt and Newtmgr Tools"},{"location":"faq/go_env/#contributing-to-newt-or-newtmgr-tools","text":"Newt and Newtmgr are written in Go (golang).

Markdown, MkDocs, Mou The Mynewt documentation you see on the Apache incubator website is a bunch of HTML files generated using MkDocs which is a simple static site generation tool geared towards building project documentation. You can read about it at http://www.mkdocs.org . Documentation source files are written in Markdown, and configured with a single YAML configuration file. Markdown is a lightweight markup language with plain text formatting syntax designed so that it can be converted to HTML and many other formats using a tool (which in our case is MkDocs). The HTML pages are generated periodically after changes have been reviewed and accepted into the master branch. Access to the Apache repo Get an account on Apache. You do not need a committer account to view the website or clone the repository but you need it to push changes to it. If you are not a committer, you may follow the proposed non-committer workflow to share your work. The direct link to the proposed workflow is https://git-wip-us.apache.org/docs/workflow.html . You will find the steps described in more detail later in this tutorial. Editing an existing page Create a fork on the github mirror . Create a new branch to work on your documentation and move to that branch. $ git checkout -b <your-branch-name> Make changes directly on github.com. Generate a pull request. Alternatively, you can edit locally on your machine, push the branch (or the changes in the branch) to your fork on github.com, and then generate a pull request. Adding a new page If you create a new file somewhere in the docs subdirectory to add a new page, you have to add a line in the mkdocs.yml file at the correct level. For example, if you add a new module named \"Wi-Fi\" by creating a new file named wifi.md in the network directory, you have to insert the following line under Networking User Guide in the mkdocs.yml file (at the same level as the docs directory). In this example, a link will show up in the navigation bar on the left under \"Networking User Guide\" titled \"Wi-Fi\" and take the user to the contents of the 'wifi.md' file when the link is clicked. Note: The change will show up on this Mynewt site only after your pull request is merged in and the updated site is generated. - 'Wi-Fi': 'wifi.md' Local preview of HTML files You have the option to install MkDocs and do a local conversion yourself to preview the pages using the built-in webserver that comes with MkDocs. In order to install MkDocs you'll need Python installed on your system, as well as the Python package manager, pip. You can check if you have them already (usually you will). $ python --version Python 2.7.2 $ pip --version pip 1.5.2 $ pip install mkdocs You will then run the built-in webserver from the root of the documentation directory using the command mkdocs serve . The root directory for documentation is incubator-mynewt-site or the directory with the mkdocs.yml file. $ ls docs images mkdocs.yml $ mkdocs serve Then go to http://127.0.0.1:8000 to preview your pages and see how they will look on the website.

Visual Studio Code is supported on Mac OS, Linux, and Windows. This guide shows you how to: Install Visual Studio Code. Install the C/C++ and debugger extensions. Define task configurations to build Mynewt applications. Define debugger configurations to debug Mynewt applications. Launch the debugger. Prerequisites: Have Internet connectivity to fetch remote Mynewt components. Have a computer to build a Mynewt application. Perform native installation for the Mynewt tools and toolchains. Note: For Windows platforms, ensure that the MinGW bash you install is added to your Windows Path. In addition, if you are using Windows 10 WSL, you must have the MinGW bash before the Windows 10 WSL bash in your Windows Path. Read the Mynewt OS Concepts section. Create a project space (directory structure) and populate it with the core code repository (apache-mynewt-core) or know how to as explained in Creating Your First Project. Complete one of the Blinky Tutorials . Notes: This guide is not a tutorial for Visual Studio Code. It assumes you are familiar with Visual Studio Code. If this is your first time using Visual Studio Code, we recommend that you read the Visual Studio Code documentation and tutorials and evaluate whether you would like to use it to develop Mynewt applications. This guide uses Visual Studio Code on Windows. Visual Studio Code is supported on Linux and Mac OS but may have some variations in the keyboard shortcuts and command names for these platforms. You can also use the Eclipse IDE to develop Mynewt applications. See https://www.codecoup.pl/blog/hacking-mynewt-in-eclipse for more details. On Windows platforms, you must also ensure the MinGW bash is set in your Windows Path as described in the prerequisites. Installing Visual Studio Code Download and install Visual Studio Code from https://code.visualstudio.com/ . Installing the C/C++ and Debugger Extensions You need to install two extensions: The C/C++ extension from Microsoft. This extension provides language support such as symbol searching, signatuare help, go to definition, and go to declaration. The Native Debug extension from webfreak. This extension provides GDB support. To install the C/C++ extension: Press Ctrl-P to open the search box. Type ext install cpptools in the search box and press Enter. You should see the extension at the top of the list. Click Install to install the extension. To install the Native Debugger: Press Ctrl-P to open the search box. Type ext install webfreak.debug in the search box and press Enter. You should see the Native Debug extension at the top of the list. Click Install to install the extension. Defining Tasks for Mynewt Projects Two main concepts in Visual Studio Code are workspaces and tasks. A workspace represents a folder that is open. You can open multiple workspaces and switch between workspaces. Tasks allow you to integrate the external tools and operations that are used to build or test your project into Visual Studio Code. Tasks are run from and the task results can be analyzed in Visual Studio Code. Tasks are defined within the scope of a workspace. This means that the tasks you define for a workspace only apply to the given workspace. Associating a Mynewt Project to a Workspace For your Mynewt project, your Visual Studio Code workspace is the Mynewt project base directory. For example, if you create a project named myproj under the ~/dev directory, then you open the ~/dev/myproj folder for your workspace. Select File > Open Folder , and select the myproj folder from the Select Folder dialog box to open the folder. Defining Visual Studio Code Tasks to Build and Debug Mynewt Applications You define Visual Studio Code tasks to build and debug your Mynewt targets in Visual Studio Code. We use the Blinky application for the Arduino Zero board from the Blinky On Arduino Zero Tutorial to illustrate how to define the tasks to build and debug the Arduino blinky bootloader and application targets. Perform the following steps to create the tasks to build and debug the Arduino blinky bootloader and appliction targets: Step 1: Press Ctrl-Shift-P , type task , and select Tasks:Configure Task Runner from the search results. Step 2: Select Others (scroll down to the bottom of the list) to create a task runner for external commands. Tasks are defined in the tasks.json file. You should see the .vscode folder created in the MYPROJ folder and a tasks.json file created in the .vscode folder. The tasks.json file has the following default values. The sample tasks.json file defines a simple task that runs the echo command with \"Hello World\" as the argument. Step 3: Delete the content from the tasks.json file, add the following definitions, and press Ctrl-S to save the file. { \"version\": \"0.1.0\", \"command\": \"newt\", \"echoCommand\": true, \"isShellCommand\": true, \"tasks\":[ { \"taskName\": \"build_arduino_boot\", \"args\": [\"build\", \"arduino_boot\"], \"suppressTaskName\": true }, { \"taskName\": \"build_arduino_blinky\", \"args\": [\"build\", \"arduino_blinky\"], \"isBuildCommand\": true, \"suppressTaskName\": true }, { \"taskName\": \"create_arduino_blinky\", \"args\": [\"create-image\", \"arduino_blinky\", \"1.0.0\"], \"suppressTaskName\":true }, { \"taskName\": \"debug_arduino_blinky\", \"args\": [\"debug\", \"arduino_blinky\", \"-n\"], \"suppressTaskName\": true } ] } The tasks.json file specifies the tasks that are run to build and debug the Arduino blinky targets. Each task runs a newt command. The newt command to run and the arguments for the newt command are passed in the args property for each task. The following tasks are defined in this example: build_arduino_boot : Runs the newt build arduino_boot command to build the arduino_boot target. build_arduino_blinky : Runs the newt build arduino_blinky command to build the arduino_blinky target. Note: This task sets the isBuildCommand property to true . This is an optional property that, when set to true, allows you to run the Tasks: Run Build Task ( Ctrl-Shift-B ) command to start the task. create_arduino_blinky : Runs the newt create-image arduino_blinky command to create the image file. debug_arduino_blinky : Runs the newt build arduino_blinky -n command to debug the arduino_blinky target. The -n flag is specified to start only the GDB server and not the GDB client. We will launch the GDB client from Visual Studio Code. For more information on tasks and all supported properties, see the Visual Studio Code Task documentation . Running a Task To run a task, press Ctrl-Shift-P , type task on the search box, and select Tasks: Run Task . The tasks that you define in the tasks.json file are listed. Select the task to run. The following is an example of running the build_arduino_boot task: Note :To run the build_arduino_linky task, you can use the keyboard shortcut Ctrl-Shift-B because the task has the property isBuildCommand set to true. Defining Tasks for Other Newt Commands Other newt commands, such as the newt load command, do not need to run from within Visual Studio Code. You can define a task for each command as a convenience and run the command as a task, or you can run the newt command on the command line from the Visual Studio Code integrated terminal or an external terminal. To create the tasks for the newt load arduino_boot and newt laod arduino_blinky commands, add the following definitions to the tasks.json file: { \"taskName\": \"load_arduino_boot\", \"args\": [\"load\", \"arduino_boot\"], \"suppressTaskName\":true }, { \"taskName\": \"load_arduino_blinky\", \"args\": [\"load\", \"arduino_blinky\"], \"suppressTaskName\":true }, To run a command from the Visual Studio integrated terminal, instead of starting a task, press Ctrl-` to launch the integrated terminal and enter the command on the prompt: Defining Debugger Configurations You need to define a debugger configuration to launch the GDB debugger from within Visual Studio Code: Step 1: Select Debug > Open Configuration , and select the GDB environment. You should see a default launch.json file created in the .vscode folder. Step 2: Delete the content from the launch.json file, add the following definitions, and press 'Ctrl-S' to save the file. { \"version\": \"0.2.0\", \"configurations\": [ { \"name\": \"gdb_arduino_blinky\", \"type\": \"gdb\", \"request\": \"attach\", \"executable\": \"${workspaceRoot}\\\\bin\\\\targets\\\\arduino_blinky\\\\app\\\\apps\\\\blinky\\\\blinky.elf\", \"target\": \":3333\", \"cwd\": \"${workspaceRoot}\", \"gdbpath\": \"C:\\\\Program Files (x86)\\\\GNU Tools ARM Embedded\\\\4.9 2015q2\\\\bin\\\\arm-none-eabi-gdb.exe\", \"remote\": true } ] } This defines a gdb_arduino_blinky debugger configuration. It specifies: The debugger is type gdb . To use the blinky.elf file for the executable. To use port 3333 to connect with the remote target. To use arm-none-eabi-gdb for the GDB program. Debugging Your Application To debug your application, start the GDB server and launch the GDB session from Visual Studio Code. For the the arduino blinky example, perform the following: Step 1: Run the debug_arduino_blinky task to start the GDB server. Perform the following: Press Ctrl-Shift-P and type task in the search box. Select Tasks:Run Task > debug_arduino_blinky . Press Ctrl-Shift-U to open the Output Panel and see the OpenOCD GDB Server output. Step 2: Start the GDB session. Perform the following: Press Ctrl-Shift-Y to view the Debug Console. Press the Debugging icon on the activity bar (Ctrl-Shift-D) to bring up the Debug Side Bar. Select gdb_arduino_blinky from the DEBUG drop down menu. Press the green play button to start the gdb session. Step 3: Debug your application. You should see a debug session similar to the one shown below: For more information on how to use the Visual Studio Code Debugger, see the Visual Studio Code debugging documentation . Working with Multiple Mynewt Applications As mentioned previously, each mynewt project corresponds to a Visual Studio Code workspace. If you have multiple Mynewt application targets defined in same project, you will need to define build and debug tasks for each target in the tasks.json file and debugger configurations for the targets in the launch.json file for the workspace. If you have a different Mynewt project for each mynewt application, you will need to define build and debug tasks in the tasks.json file and the debugger configuration in the launch.json file for each workspace.","title":"Using an IDE to Develop Mynewt Applications"},{"location":"faq/ide/#developing-mynewt-applications-with-visual-studio-code","text":"This guide shows you how to set up Visual Studio Code to develop and debug Mynewt applications.

It is called NimBLE. BLE technology operates in the unlicensed industrial, scientific and medical (ISM) band at 2.4 to 2.485 GHz which is available in most countries. It uses a spread spectrum, frequency hopping, full-duplex signal. BLE FHSS employs 40 2-MHz-wide channels to ensure greater reliability over longer distances. It also features 0-dBm (1 mW) power output and a typical maximum range of 50 meters. Note that BLE is not compatible with standard Bluetooth.

LE Data Length Extension for higher throughput Coming Soon : Assigning an Internet Protocol (IP) address (complaint with the IPv6 or 6LoWPAN standard) to a Bluetooth device through Internet Protocol Support Profile (IPSP) Components A Bluetooth low energy stack (NimBLE included) consists of two components with several subcomponents: Controller Physical Layer : adaptive frequency-hopping Gaussian Frequency Shift Keying (GFSK) radio using 40 RF channels (0-39), with 2 MHz spacing. Link Layer : with one of five states (Standby, Advertising, Scanning, Initiating, Connection states) active at any time Host Logical Link Control and Adaptation Protocol (L2CAP) : provides logical channels, named L2CAP channels, which are multiplexed over one or more logical links to provide packet segmentation and reassembly, flow control, error control, streaming, QoS etc. Security Manager (SM) : uses Security Manager Protocol (SMP) for pairing and transport specific key distribution for securing radio communication Attribute protocol (ATT) : allows a device ( Server ) to expose certain pieces of data, known as Attributes , to another device ( Client ) Generic Attribute Profile (GATT) : a framework for using the ATT protocol to exchange attributes encapsulated as Characteristics or Services Generic Access Profile (GAP) : a base profile which all Bluetooth devices implement, which in the case of LE, defines the Physical Layer, Link Layer, L2CAP, Security Manager, Attribute Protocol and Generic Attribute Profile. Host Controller Interface (HCI) : the interface between the host and controller either through software API or by a hardware interface such as SPI, UART or USB. Subsequent chapters in this manual will go into the details of the implementation of each component, APIs available, and things to consider while designing a NimBLE app. Example NimBLE projects Mynewt comes with several built-in projects or applications using NimBLE. These allow users to try out NimBLE, understand how to use available services, and build their own applications using one or more of the examples as seed. bletiny : A simple shell application which provides a basic interface to the host-side of the BLE stack. Supported operations include GAP, GATT, and L2CAP. bleprph : A basic peripheral device with no user interface. It advertises automatically on startup, and resumes advertising whenever a connection is terminated. It supports a maximum of one connection. blecent : A basic central device with no user interface. This application scans for a peripheral that supports the alert notification service (ANS). Upon discovering such a peripheral, blecent connects and performs the following actions: Reads the ANS Supported New Alert Category characteristic. Writes the ANS Alert Notification Control Point characteristic. Subscribes to notifications for the ANS Unread Alert Status characteristic. blehci : Implements a BLE controller-only application.

For detailed specifications, see BLUETOOTH SPECIFICATION Version 4.2 [Vol 1, Part A]. Pairing : The process for creating one or more shared secret keys. In LE a single link key is generated by combining contributions from each device into a link key used during pairing. Bonding : The act of storing the keys created during pairing for use in subsequent connections in order to form a trusted device pair. Device authentication : Verification that the two devices have the same keys (verify device identity) Encryption : Keeps message confidential. Encryption in Bluetooth LE uses AES-CCM cryptography and is performed in the Controller . Message integrity : Protects against message forgeries. Bluetooth LE uses four association models depending on the I/O capabilities of the devices. Just Works : designed for scenarios where at least one of the devices does not have a display capable of displaying a six digit number nor does it have a keyboard capable of entering six decimal digits. Numeric Comparison : designed for scenarios where both devices are capable of displaying a six digit number and both are capable of having the user enter \"yes\" or \"no\". A good example of this model is the cell phone / PC scenario. Out of Band : designed for scenarios where an Out of Band mechanism is used to both discover the devices as well as to exchange or transfer cryptographic numbers used in the pairing process. Passkey Entry : designed for the scenario where one device has input capability but does not have the capability to display six digits and the other device has output capabilities. A good example of this model is the PC and keyboard scenario. Key Generation Key generation for all purposes in Bluetooth LE is performed by the Host on each LE device independent of any other LE device. Privacy Feature Bluetooth LE supports an optional feature during connection mode and connection procedures that reduces the ability to track a LE device over a period of time by changing the Bluetooth device address on a frequent basis. There are two variants of the privacy feature. In the first variant, private addresses are resolved and generated by the Host . In the second variant, private addresses are resolved and generated by the Controller without involving the Host after the Host provides the Controller device identity information. The Host may provide the Controller with a complete resolving list or a subset of the resolving list. Device filtering becomes possible in the second variant when address resolution is performed in the Controller because the peer\u2019s device identity address can be resolved prior to checking whether it is in the white list. Note : When address resolution is performed exclusively in the Host, a device may experience increased power consumption because device filtering must be disabled.

Use the following steps to create minimal ... 1. Create the app directory structure. ~/dev/my_proj1$ mkdir -p apps/ble_app/src 2. Paste the following contents into apps/ble_app/pkg.yml . pkg.name: apps/ble_app pkg.type: app pkg.deps: - \"@apache-mynewt-core/kernel/os\" - \"@apache-mynewt-core/hw/hal\" - \"@apache-mynewt-core/sys/console/full\" - \"@apache-mynewt-core/sys/log/full\" - \"@apache-mynewt-core/sys/stats/full\" - \"@apache-mynewt-core/net/nimble/transport/ram\" - \"@apache-mynewt-core/net/nimble/controller\" - \"@apache-mynewt-core/net/nimble/host\" 3.

If it does, this should be an error */ assert ( 0 ); } In this main() all we are doing is initializing the Mynewt OS and starting it. Create the target Now you have to create the target that you will use to build your application. We will call this target \"ble_tgt\". Type the newt target create ble_tgt command. You should get this: ~/dev/my_proj1$ newt target create ble_tgt Target targets/ble_tgt successfully created What this command just did was to create a directory called ble_tgt in the targets directory of your project. Two files are created in that directory: pkg.yml and target.yml. The target is not yet complete though! We need to set some target variables for this project. Currently, the nimble stack has been ported to the Nordic nrf5x chipsets; specifically the nrf51 and nrf52. This application will use the nrf52 but we will also show the setup for the nrf51 in case your project uses that chip. Here is the command you will need to set up your target for the nrf52: ~/dev/my_proj1$ newt target set ble_tgt \\ app=apps/ble_app \\ bsp=@apache-mynewt-core/hw/bsp/nrf52pdk \\ build_profile=optimized Target targets/ble_tgt successfully set target.app to apps/ble_app Target targets/ble_tgt successfully set target.bsp to @apache-mynewt-core/hw/bsp/nrf52pdk Target targets/ble_tgt successfully set target.build_profile to optimized Here is the command you will need to set up your target for the nrf51: ~/dev/my_proj1$ newt target set ble_tgt \\ app=apps/ble_app \\ bsp=@apache-mynewt-core/hw/bsp/nrf51dk \\ build_profile=optimized Target targets/ble_tgt successfully set target.app to apps/ble_app Target targets/ble_tgt successfully set target.bsp to @apache-mynewt-core/hw/bsp/nrf51dk Target targets/ble_tgt successfully set target.build_profile to optimized Nimble stack initialization There are certain stack initialization steps that are required for a BLE application to be up and running. If you are running a canned example (e.g. bletiny), these steps are already done for you. When you are writing your own app, you may want to assign different initial values or initialize additional packages that you may have added to your project or written yourself. Details of the initialization step requirements are covered in Initialize Stack step. Building the application Now that we have created the application and the target we can build it and test it out. The command you need to run is the newt build command with the target we created ( ble_tgt ). The output will show the files being compiled and linked. You should see this when all is done (except for the ... of course): ~/dev/my_proj1$ newt build ble_tgt ... Archiving os.a Compiling cons_fmt.c Compiling cons_tty.c Archiving full.a Linking ble_app.elf App successfully built: /Users/wes/dev/my_proj1/bin/ble_tgt/apps/ble_app/ble_app.elf Conclusion You now have a fully functional BLE app (never mind the fact that it doesn't actually do anything yet!). With all the necessary infrastructure in place, you can now start turning this into a real application. Additional tutorials with focus on adding application-layer functionality to your Nimble application will be coming soon. In the meantime, you might get some inspiration from apache-mynewt-core's example Nimble apps.

The host encompasses several layers of the Bluetooth specification that each defines its own set of status codes. Rather than \"abstract away\" information from lower layers that the application developer might find useful, the NimBLE host aims to indicate precisely what happened when something fails. Consequently, the host utilizes a rather large set of return codes. A return code of 0 indicates success. For failure conditions, the return codes are partitioned into five separate sets: | Set | Condition | Notes| |-----|-------------| | Core | Errors detected internally by the NimBLE host. | | ATT | The ATT server has reported a failure via the transmission of an ATT Error Response. The return code corresponds to the value of the Error Code field in the response. | | HCI | The controller has reported an error to the host via a command complete or command status HCI event. The return code corresponds to the value of the Status field in the event. | L2CAP | An L2CAP signaling procedure has failed and an L2CAP Command Reject was sent as a result. The return code corresponds to the value of the Reason field in the command. | Security manager (us) | The host detected an error during a security manager procedure and sent a Pairing Failed command to the peer. The return code corresponds to the value of the Reason field in the Pairing Failed command. | | Security manager (peer) | A security manager procedure failed because the peer sent us a Pairing Failed command. The return code corresponds to the value of the Reason field in the Pairing Failed command. | The return codes in the core set are defined by the NimBLE Host. The other sets are defined in the Bluetooth specification; the codes in this latter group are referred to as formal status codes . As defined in the Bluetooth specification, the formal status code sets are not disjoint. That is, they overlap. For example, the spec defines a status code of 1 to have all of the following meanings: Layer Meaning ATT Invalid handle. HCI Unknown HCI command. L2CAP Signalling MTU exceeded. SM Passkey entry failed. Clearly, the host can't just return an unadorned formal status code and expect the application to make sense of it. To resolve this ambiguity, the NimBLE host divides the full range of an int into several subranges. Each subrange corresponds to one of the five return code sets. For example, the ATT set is mapped onto the subrange [0x100, 0x200) . To indicate an ATT error of 3 (write not permitted), the NimBLE host returns a value 0x103 to the application. The host defines a set of convenience macros for converting from a formal status code to NimBLE host status code. These macros are documented in the table below. Macro Status code set Base value BLE_HS_ATT_ERR() ATT 0x100 BLE_HS_HCI_ERR() HCI 0x200 BLE_HS_L2C_ERR() L2CAP 0x300 BLE_HS_SM_US_ERR() Security manager (us) 0x400 BLE_HS_SM_PEER_ERR() Security manager (peer) 0x500 Example The following example demonstrates how an application might determine which error is being reported by the host. In this example, the application performs the GAP encryption procedure and checks the return code. To simplify the example, the application uses a hypothetical my_blocking_enc_proc() function, which blocks until the pairing operation has completed. void encrypt_connection ( uint16_t conn_handle ) { int rc ; /* Perform a blocking GAP encryption procedure. */ rc = my_blocking_enc_proc ( conn_handle ); switch ( rc ) { case 0 : console_printf ( \"success - link successfully encrypted\\n\" ); break ; case BLE_HS_ENOTCONN : console_printf ( \"failure - no connection with handle %d\\n\" , conn_handle ); break ; case BLE_HS_ERR_SM_US_BASE ( BLE_SM_ERR_CONFIRM_MISMATCH ) : console_printf ( \"failure - mismatch in peer's confirm and random \" \"commands.\\n\" ); break ; case BLE_HS_ERR_SM_PEER_BASE ( BLE_SM_ERR_CONFIRM_MISMATCH ) : console_printf ( \"failure - peer reports mismatch in our confirm and \" \"random commands.\\n\" ); break ; default : console_printf ( \"failure - other error: 0x%04x\\n\" , rc ); break ; } } Return Code Reference Header All NimBLE host return codes are made accessible by including the following header: #include \"host/ble_hs.h\" Return codes - Core The precise meaning of each of these error codes depends on the function that returns it. The API reference for a particular function indicates the conditions under which each of these codes are returned.

The host encompasses several layers of the Bluetooth specification that each defines its own set of status codes. Rather than \"abstract away\" information from lower layers that the application developer might find useful, the NimBLE host aims to indicate precisely what happened when something fails. Consequently, the host utilizes a rather large set of return codes. A return code of 0 indicates success. For failure conditions, the return codes are partitioned into five separate sets: | Set | Condition | Notes| |-----|-------------| | Core | Errors detected internally by the NimBLE host. | | ATT | The ATT server has reported a failure via the transmission of an ATT Error Response. The return code corresponds to the value of the Error Code field in the response. | | HCI | The controller has reported an error to the host via a command complete or command status HCI event. The return code corresponds to the value of the Status field in the event. | L2CAP | An L2CAP signaling procedure has failed and an L2CAP Command Reject was sent as a result. The return code corresponds to the value of the Reason field in the command. | Security manager (us) | The host detected an error during a security manager procedure and sent a Pairing Failed command to the peer. The return code corresponds to the value of the Reason field in the Pairing Failed command. | | Security manager (peer) | A security manager procedure failed because the peer sent us a Pairing Failed command. The return code corresponds to the value of the Reason field in the Pairing Failed command. | The return codes in the core set are defined by the NimBLE Host. The other sets are defined in the Bluetooth specification; the codes in this latter group are referred to as formal status codes . As defined in the Bluetooth specification, the formal status code sets are not disjoint. That is, they overlap. For example, the spec defines a status code of 1 to have all of the following meanings: Layer Meaning ATT Invalid handle. HCI Unknown HCI command. L2CAP Signalling MTU exceeded. SM Passkey entry failed. Clearly, the host can't just return an unadorned formal status code and expect the application to make sense of it. To resolve this ambiguity, the NimBLE host divides the full range of an int into several subranges. Each subrange corresponds to one of the five return code sets. For example, the ATT set is mapped onto the subrange [0x100, 0x200) . To indicate an ATT error of 3 (write not permitted), the NimBLE host returns a value 0x103 to the application. The host defines a set of convenience macros for converting from a formal status code to NimBLE host status code. These macros are documented in the table below. Macro Status code set Base value BLE_HS_ATT_ERR() ATT 0x100 BLE_HS_HCI_ERR() HCI 0x200 BLE_HS_L2C_ERR() L2CAP 0x300 BLE_HS_SM_US_ERR() Security manager (us) 0x400 BLE_HS_SM_PEER_ERR() Security manager (peer) 0x500","title":"Summary"},{"location":"network/ble/ble_hs/ble_hs_return_codes/#example","text":"The following example demonstrates how an application might determine which error is being reported by the host.

The only devices which do not support ATT are the most basic ones: broadcasters and observers (i.e., beaconing devices and listening devices).

It is a simple shell application which provides a basic interface to the host-side of the BLE stack. \"bletiny\" includes all the possible roles (Central/Peripheral) and they may be run simultaneously. You can run bletiny on a board and issue commands that make it behave as a central or a peripheral with different peers. Highlighted below are some of the ways you can use the API to establish connections and discover services and characteristics from peer devices.

This application uses the default host configuration, so it specifies NULL as the second argument to ble_hs_init() . #include \"host/ble_hs.h\" int main ( void ) { int rc ; /* Initialize OS */ os_init (); /* Set cputime to count at 1 usec increments */ rc = cputime_init ( 1000000 ); assert ( rc == 0 ); /* Create memory pool for Nimble packets and register with Msys */ rc = os_mempool_init ( &g_mbuf_mempool , MBUF_NUM_MBUFS , MBUF_MEMBLOCK_SIZE , &g_mbuf_buffer [ 0 ], \"mbuf_pool\" ); assert ( rc == 0 ); rc = os_mbuf_pool_init ( &g_mbuf_pool , &g_mbuf_mempool , MBUF_MEMBLOCK_SIZE , MBUF_NUM_MBUFS ); assert ( rc == 0 ); rc = os_msys_register ( &g_mbuf_pool ); assert ( rc == 0 ); /* Initialize our device address */ g_dev_addr [ 0 ] = 0x33 ; g_dev_addr [ 1 ] = 0x22 ; g_dev_addr [ 2 ] = 0x11 ; g_dev_addr [ 3 ] = 0xcc ; g_dev_addr [ 4 ] = 0xbb ; g_dev_addr [ 5 ] = 0x0a ; /* Initialize the statistics package */ rc = stats_module_init (); assert ( rc == 0 ); /* Initialize the BLE LL */ rc = ble_ll_init ( 0 , 7 , 260 ); assert ( rc == 0 ); /* Initialize the application task. */ os_eventq_init ( &app_evq ); os_task_init ( &app_task , \"app\" , app_task_handler , NULL , 1 , OS_WAIT_FOREVER , app_stack , APP_STACK_SIZE ); /* Initialize the BLE host. */ rc = ble_hs_init ( &app_evq , NULL ); assert ( rc == 0 ); /* Start the OS */ os_start (); /* os start should never return.

It is a single tool that accomplishes both the following goals: source package management build, debug and install. Rationale In order for the Mynewt operating system to work well for constrained environments across the many different types of microcontroller applications (from doorbells to medical devices to power grids), a system is needed that lets you select which packages to install and which packages to build. The build systems for embedded devices are often fairly complicated and not well served for this purpose. For example, autoconf is designed for detecting system compatibility issues but not well suited when it comes to tasks like: Building for multiple targets Deciding what to build in and what not to build in Managing dependencies between components Fortunately, solutions addressing these very issues can be found in source package management systems in higher level languages such as Javascript (Node), Go, PHP and Ruby. We decided to fuse their source management systems with a make system built for embedded systems and create Newt. Build System A good build system must allow the user to take a few common steps while developing embedded applications: Generate full flash images Download debug images to a target board using a debugger Conditionally compile libraries & code based upon build settings Newt can read a directory tree, build a dependency tree, and emit the right build artifacts.

It also recognizes two important package directories in the package tree - \"apps\" and \"targets\". More on these directories in Newt Theory of Ops . When Newt builds a target, it recursively resolves all package dependencies, and generates artifacts that are placed in the bin/targets/<target-name>/app/apps/<app-name> directory, where the bin directory is under the project base directory, target-name is the name of the target, and app-name is the name of the application. For our example my_blinky_sim is the name of the target and blinky is the name of the application.

Source Management and Repositories The other major element of the Newt tool is the ability to create reusable source distributions from a collection of code. A project can be a reusable container of source code. In other words, projects can be versioned and redistributed, not packages. A project bundles together packages that are typically needed to work together in a product e.g. RTOS core, filesystem APIs, and networking stack. A project that has been made redistributable is known as a repository . Repositories can be added to your local project by adding them into your project.yml file. Here is an example of the blinky project's yml file which relies on apache-mynewt-core: $ more project.yml <snip> project.repositories: - apache-mynewt-core # Use github's distribution mechanism for core ASF libraries. # This provides mirroring automatically for us. # repository.apache-mynewt-core: type: github vers: 1-latest user: apache repo: incubator-mynewt-core When you specify this repository in the blinky's project file, you can then use the Newt tool to install dependencies: $ newt install Downloading repository description for apache-mynewt-core... success!

For example, autoconf is designed for detecting system compatibility issues but not well suited when it comes to tasks like: Building for multiple targets Deciding what to build in and what not to build in Managing dependencies between components Fortunately, solutions addressing these very issues can be found in source package management systems in higher level languages such as Javascript (Node), Go, PHP and Ruby.

It also recognizes two important package directories in the package tree - \"apps\" and \"targets\". More on these directories in Newt Theory of Ops . When Newt builds a target, it recursively resolves all package dependencies, and generates artifacts that are placed in the bin/targets/<target-name>/app/apps/<app-name> directory, where the bin directory is under the project base directory, target-name is the name of the target, and app-name is the name of the application.

You can see that there are two essential package directories, \"apps\" and \"targets.\" \"apps\" Package Directory apps is where applications are stored, and applications are where the main() function is contained. The base project directory comes with one simple app called blinky in the apps directory. The core repository @apache-mynewt-core comes with many additional sample apps in its apps directory. At the time of this writing, there are several example BLE apps, the boot app, slinky app for using newt manager protocol, and more in that directory. @~/dev/myproj$ ls repos/apache-mynewt-core/apps/ blecent blesplit boot sensors_test splitty blehci bletest fat2native slinky test bleprph bletiny ffs2native slinky_oic testbench bleprph_oic bleuart ocf_sample spitest timtest Along with the targets directory, apps represents the top-level of the build tree for the particular project, and define the dependencies for the rest of the system. Mynewt users and developers can add their own apps to the project's apps directory. The app definition is contained in a pkg.yml file. For example, blinky's pkg.yml file is: $ more apps/blinky/pkg.yml <snip> pkg.name: apps/blinky pkg.type: app pkg.description: Basic example application which blinks an LED. pkg.author: \"Apache Mynewt <dev@mynewt.incubator.apache.org>\" pkg.homepage: \"http://mynewt.apache.org/\" pkg.keywords: pkg.deps: - \"@apache-mynewt-core/kernel/os\" - \"@apache-mynewt-core/hw/hal\" - \"@apache-mynewt-core/sys/console/full\" This file says that the name of the package is apps/blinky, and it depends on the kernel/os, hw/hal and sys/console/full` packages. NOTE: @apache-mynewt-core is a repository descriptor, and this will be covered in the \"repository\" section. \"targets\" Package Directory targets is where targets are stored, and each target is a collection of parameters that must be passed to newt in order to generate a reproducible build. Along with the apps directory, targets represents the top of the build tree. Any packages or parameters specified at the target level cascades down to all dependencies. Most targets consist of: app: The application to build bsp: The board support package to combine with that application build_profile: Either debug or optimized. The my_blinky_sim target that is included by default has the following settings: $ newt target show targets/my_blinky_sim app=apps/blinky bsp=@apache-mynewt-core/hw/bsp/native build_profile=debug $ ls targets/my_blinky_sim/ pkg.yml target.yml There are helper functions to aid the developer specify parameters for a target. vals : Displays all valid values for the specified parameter type (e.g. bsp for a target) target show : Displays the variable values for either a specific target or all targets defined for the project target set : Sets values for target variables In general, the three basic parameters of a target ( app , bsp , and build_profile ) are stored in the target's target.yml file in the targets/<target-name> directory, where target-name is the name of the target. You will also see a pkg.yml file in the same directory. Since targets are packages, a pkg.yml is expected. It contains typical package descriptors, dependencies, and additional parameters such as the following: Cflags: Any additional compiler flags you might want to specify to the build Aflags: Any additional assembler flags you might want to specify to the build Lflags: Any additional linker flags you might want to specify to the build You can also override the values of the system configuration settings that are defined by the packages that your target includes. You override the values in your target's syscfg.yml file (stored in the targets/<target-name> directory). You can use the newt target config show command to see the configuration settings and values for your target, and use the newt target set command to set the syscfg variable and override the configuration setting values. You can also use an editor to create your target's syscfg.yml file and add the setting values to the file. See System Configuration And Initialization for more information on system configuration settings. Resolving dependencies When newt builds a project, it will: find the top-level project.yml file recurse the packages in the package tree, and build a list of all source packages Newt then looks at the target that the user set, for example, blinky_sim: $ more targets/my_blinky_sim/ pkg.yml target.yml $ more targets/my_blinky_sim/target.yml ### Target: targets/my_blinky_sim target.app: \"apps/blinky\" target.bsp: \"@apache-mynewt-core/hw/bsp/native\" target.build_profile: \"debug\" The target specifies two major things: Application (target.app): The application to build Board Support Package (target.bsp): The board support package to build along with that application. Newt builds the dependency tree specified by all the packages. While building this tree, it does a few other things: Sets up the include paths for each package. Any package that depends on another package, automatically gets the include directories from the package it includes. Include directories in the newt structure must always be prefixed by the package name. For example, kernel/os has the following include tree and its include directory files contains the package name \"os\" before any header files. This is so in order to avoid any header file conflicts. $tree kernel/os/include kernel/os/include \u2514\u2500\u2500 os \u251c\u2500\u2500 arch \u2502 \u251c\u2500\u2500 cortex_m0 \u2502 \u2502 \u2514\u2500\u2500 os \u2502 \u2502 \u2514\u2500\u2500 os_arch.h \u2502 \u251c\u2500\u2500 cortex_m4 \u2502 \u2502 \u2514\u2500\u2500 os \u2502 \u2502 \u2514\u2500\u2500 os_arch.h \u2502 \u251c\u2500\u2500 mips \u2502 \u2502 \u2514\u2500\u2500 os \u2502 \u2502 \u2514\u2500\u2500 os_arch.h \u2502 \u251c\u2500\u2500 sim \u2502 \u2502 \u2514\u2500\u2500 os \u2502 \u2502 \u2514\u2500\u2500 os_arch.h \u2502 \u2514\u2500\u2500 sim-mips \u2502 \u2514\u2500\u2500 os \u2502 \u2514\u2500\u2500 os_arch.h \u251c\u2500\u2500 endian.h \u251c\u2500\u2500 os.h \u251c\u2500\u2500 os_callout.h \u251c\u2500\u2500 os_cfg.h \u251c\u2500\u2500 os_cputime.h \u251c\u2500\u2500 os_dev.h \u251c\u2500\u2500 os_eventq.h \u251c\u2500\u2500 os_fault.h \u251c\u2500\u2500 os_heap.h \u251c\u2500\u2500 os_malloc.h \u251c\u2500\u2500 os_mbuf.h \u251c\u2500\u2500 os_mempool.h \u251c\u2500\u2500 os_mutex.h \u251c\u2500\u2500 os_sanity.h \u251c\u2500\u2500 os_sched.h \u251c\u2500\u2500 os_sem.h \u251c\u2500\u2500 os_task.h \u251c\u2500\u2500 os_test.h \u251c\u2500\u2500 os_time.h \u2514\u2500\u2500 queue.h <snip> Validates API requirements. Packages can export APIs they implement, (i.e. pkg.api: hw-hal-impl), and other packages can require those APIs (i.e. pkg.req_api: hw-hal-impl). Reads and validates the configuration setting definitions and values from the package syscfg.yml files. It generates a syscfg.h header file that packages include in the source files in order to access the settings. It also generates a system initialization function to initialize the packages. See System Configuration And Initialization for more information. In order to properly resolve all dependencies in the build system, newt recursively processes the package dependencies until there are no new dependencies. And it builds a big list of all the packages that need to be build. Newt then goes through this package list, and builds every package into an archive file. NOTE: The newt tool generates compiler dependencies for all of these packages, and only rebuilds the packages whose dependencies have changed. Changes in package & project dependencies are also taken into account. It is smart, after all! Producing artifacts Once newt has built all the archive files, it then links the archive files together.

Most targets consist of: app: The application to build bsp: The board support package to combine with that application build_profile: Either debug or optimized. The my_blinky_sim target that is included by default has the following settings: $ newt target show targets/my_blinky_sim app=apps/blinky bsp=@apache-mynewt-core/hw/bsp/native build_profile=debug $ ls targets/my_blinky_sim/ pkg.yml target.yml There are helper functions to aid the developer specify parameters for a target. vals : Displays all valid values for the specified parameter type (e.g. bsp for a target) target show : Displays the variable values for either a specific target or all targets defined for the project target set : Sets values for target variables In general, the three basic parameters of a target ( app , bsp , and build_profile ) are stored in the target's target.yml file in the targets/<target-name> directory, where target-name is the name of the target. You will also see a pkg.yml file in the same directory. Since targets are packages, a pkg.yml is expected. It contains typical package descriptors, dependencies, and additional parameters such as the following: Cflags: Any additional compiler flags you might want to specify to the build Aflags: Any additional assembler flags you might want to specify to the build Lflags: Any additional linker flags you might want to specify to the build You can also override the values of the system configuration settings that are defined by the packages that your target includes. You override the values in your target's syscfg.yml file (stored in the targets/<target-name> directory). You can use the newt target config show command to see the configuration settings and values for your target, and use the newt target set command to set the syscfg variable and override the configuration setting values.

In order to properly resolve all dependencies in the build system, newt recursively processes the package dependencies until there are no new dependencies. And it builds a big list of all the packages that need to be build. Newt then goes through this package list, and builds every package into an archive file.

The subcommands take one or two target-name arguments. Sub-command Explanation config The config command allows you to view or populate a target's system configuration settings. A target's system configuration settings include the settings of all the packages it includes. The settings for a package are listed in the package's syscfg.yml file. The config command has two subcommands: show and init . The config show <target-name> command displays the system configuration setting definitions and values for all the packages that the target-name target includes. The config init <target-name> command populates the target's syscfg.yml file with the system configuration values for all the packages that the target-name target includes. copy The copy <src-target> <dst-target> command creates a new target named dst-target by cloning the src-target target. create The create <target-name> command creates an empty target named target-name . It creates the targets/target-name directory and the skeleton pkg.yml and target.yml files in the directory. delete The delete <target-name> command deletes the description for the target-name target. It deletes the 'targets/target-name' directory. It does not delete the 'bin/targets/target-name' directory where the build artifacts are stored. If you want to delete the build artifacts, run the newt clean <target-name> command before deleting the target. dep The dep <target-name> command displays a dependency tree for the packages that the target-name target includes. It shows each package followed by the list of libraries or packages that it depends on. revdep The revdep <target-name> command displays the reverse dependency tree for the packages that the target-name target includes. It shows each package followed by the list of libraries or packages that depend on it. set The set <target-name> <var-name=var-value> [var-name=var-value...] command sets variables (attributes) for the <target-name> target. The set command overwrites your current variable values. The valid var-name values are: app , bsp , loader , build_profile , cflags , lflags , aflags , syscfg . The var-value format depends on the var-name as follows: app , bsp , loader : @<source-path>, where source-path is the directory containing the application or bsp source. These variables are stored in the target's target.yml file. For a simulated target, e.g. for software testing purposes, set bsp to @apache-mynewt-core/hw/bsp/native . build_profile : optimized or debug cflags , aflags , lflags : A string of flags, with each flag separated by a space. These variables are saved in the target's pkg.yml file. syscfg : The syscfg variable allows you to assign values to configuration settings in your target's syscfg.yml file. The format is syscfg=setting-name1=setting-value1[:setting-name2=setting-value2...] , where setting-name1 is a configuration setting name and setting-value1 is the value to assign to settingname1 . If settingvalue1 is not specified, the setting is set to value 1 . You use a : to delimit each setting when you set multiple settings. Warning : All existing setting values in the syscfg.yml file are deleted. Only new settings that are specified in the command are saved in the syscfg.yml file. You can specify var-name= or var-name=\"\" to unset a variable value. To display all the existing values for a target variable (attribute), you can run the newt vals <variable-name> command. For example, newt vals app displays the valid values available for the variable app for any target. show The show [target-name] command shows the values of the variables (attributes) for the target-name target. When target-name is not specified, the command shows the variables for all the targets that are defined for your project.

This page shows you how to build the newt tool from the lastest source on the master branch of the Mynewt newt git repository . The tool is written in Go (golang). In Windows, we use MinGW as the development environment to build and run Mynewt OS applications for target boards. MinGW runs the bash shell and provides a Unix-like environment. This provides a uniform way to build Mynewt OS applications. The Mynewt documentation and tutorials use Unix commands and you can use the same Unix commands on MinGW to follow the tutorials. The documentation will note any commands or behaviors that are specific to Windows. This guide shows you how to perform the following: Install MSYS2/MinGW. Install Git. Install Go. Setup the Go environment. Download the source, build, and install the newt tool. Step 1: Installing MSYS2/MinGW MSYS2/MinGW provides a bash shell and tools to build applications that run on Windows. It includes three subsystems: MSYS2 toolchain to build POSIX applications that run on Windows. MinGW32 toolchains to build 32 bit native Windows applications. MinGW64 toolchains to build 64 bit native Windows applications. The subsystems run the bash shell and provide a Unix-like environment. You can also run Windows applications from the shell. We will use the MinGW subsystem. Note: You can skip this installation step if you already have MinGW installed (from an earlier MSYS2/MinGW or Git Bash installation), but you must list the bin path for your installation in your Windows Path. For example: if you installed MSYS2/MinGW in the C:\\msys64 directory, add C:\\msys64\\usr\\bin to your Windows Path. If you are using Windows 10 WSL, ensure that you use the C:\\msys64\\usr\\bin\\bash.exe and not the Windows 10 WSL bash. To install and setup MSYS2 and MinGW: Download and run the MSYS2 installer . Select the 64 bit version if you are running on a 64 bit platform. Follow the prompts and check the Run MSYS2 now checkbox on the Installation Complete dialog. In the MSYS2 terminal, run the pacman -Syuu command. If you get a message to run the update again, close the terminal and run the pacman -Syuu command in a new terminal. To start a new MSYS2 terminal, select the \"MSYS2 MSYS\" application from the Windows start menu. Add a new user variable named MSYS2_PATH_TYPE and set the value to inherit in your Windows environment. This enables the MSYS2 and MinGW bash to inherit your Windows user Path values. To add the variable, select properties for your computer > Advanced system settings > Environment Variables > New Add the MinGW bin path to your Windows Path. For example: if you install MSYS2/MinGW in the C:\\msys64 directory, add C:\\msys64\\usr\\bin to your Windows Path. Note: If you are using Windows 10 WSL, ensure that you use the C:\\msys64\\usr\\bin\\bash.exe and not the Windows 10 WSL bash. Run the pacman -Su vim command to install the vim editor. Note: You can also use a Windows editor. You can access your files from the C:\\<msys-install-folder>\\home\\<username> folder, where msys-install-folder is the folder you installed MSYS2 in. For example, if you installed MSYS2 in the msys64 folder, your files are stored in C:\\msys64\\home\\<username> You will need to start a MinGW terminal to run the commands specified in the Mynewt documentation and tutorials. To start a MinGW terminal, select the \"MSYS2 Mingw\" application from the start Menu (you can use either MinGW32 or MinGW64). In Windows, we use the MingGW subsystem to build Mynewt tools and applications. Step 2: Installing Git for Windows Download and install Git for Windows if it is not already installed. Step 3: Installing Go Download and install the latest version of Go . Newt requires Go version 1.7 or higher. Step 4: Setting Up Your Go Environment This section describes the Go environment and how to setup a Go workspace. Go provides an environment to compile Go code, construct Go packages, and import Go code. You will use Go commands to import the newt package repository into your local Go environment. The Go language environment dictates a specific directory structure, or workspace in Go parlance. It must contain three sibling directories with the names src , pkg and bin : src contains Go source files organized into packages (one package per directory) pkg contains package objects bin contains the Go application executables that Go builds and installs. The GOPATH environment variable specifies the location of your workspace. To setup this workspace environment, create a dev directory and then a go directory under it. Set the GOPATH environment variable to this directory where you will clone the newt repository. Start up a MinGW terminal and run the following commands to set up your Go workspace: $ cd $HOME $ mkdir -p dev/go $ cd dev/go $ export GOPATH=`pwd` Add the following export statements to your ~/.bash_profile file and source the file: export GOPATH=$HOME/dev/go export PATH=$GOPATH/bin:$PATH Step 5: Downloading the Source and Installing the Newt Tool The newt Go package is mynewt.apache.org/newt/newt and is stored in the Apache Mynewt newt tool repository mirrored on github . We use the go get command to download the source, build, and install the newt tool binary in the $GOPATH/bin directory.

Examples of these devices are connected locks, lights, and wearables. Microcontroller environments have a number of characteristics that makes the operating system requirements for them unique: Low memory footprint: memory on these systems range from 8-16KB (on the low end) to 16MB (on the high end). Reduced code size: code often runs out of flash, and total available code size ranges from 64-128KB to 16-32MB. Low processing speed: processor speeds vary from 10-12MHz to 160-200MHz. Low power operation: devices operate in mostly sleeping mode, in order to conserve battery power and maximize power usage. As more and more devices get connected, these interconnected devices perform complex tasks. To perform these tasks, you need low-level operational functionality built into the operating system. Typically, connected devices built with these microcontrollers perform a myriad of functions: Networking Stacks: Bluetooth Low Energy and Thread Peripherals: PWM to drive motors, ADCs to measure sensor data, and RTCs to keep time. Scheduled Processing: actions must happen on a calendared or periodic basis. Apache Mynewt accomplishes all the above easily, by providing a complete operating system for constrained devices, including: A fully open-source Bluetooth Low Energy stack with both Host and Controller implementations. A pre-emptive, multi-tasking Real Time operating system kernel A Hardware Abstraction Layer (HAL) that abstracts the MCU's peripheral functions, allowing developers to easily write cross-platform code.

Each of these features is described in detail in its own section of the manual. A multitasking, preemptive operating system is one in which a number of different tasks can be instantiated and assigned a priority, with higher priority tasks running before lower priority tasks. Furthermore, if a lower priority task is running and a higher priority task wants to run, the lower priority task is halted and the higher priority task is allowed to run. In other words, the lower priority task is preempted by the higher priority task. Why use an OS? You may ask yourself \"why do I need a multitasking preemptive OS\"? The answer may indeed be that you do not. Some applications are simple and only require a polling loop. Others are more complex and may require that certain jobs are executed in a timely manner or before other jobs are executed. If you have a simple polling loop, you cannot move on to service a job until the current job is done being serviced. With the Mynewt OS, the application developer need not worry about certain jobs taking too long or not executing in a timely fashion; the OS provides mechanisms to deal with these situations. Another benefit of using an OS is that it helps shield application developers from other application code being written; the developer does not have to worry (or has to worry less) about other application code behaving badly and causing undesirable behavior or preventing their code from executing properly. Other benefits of using an OS (and the Mynewt OS in particular) is that it also provides features that the developer would otherwise need to create on his/her own. Core OS Features Scheduler/context switching Time Tasks Event queues/callouts Semaphores Mutexes Memory pools Heap Mbufs Sanity Callouts Porting OS to other platforms Basic OS Application Creation Creating an application using the Mynewt Core OS is a relatively simple task. The main steps are: Install the basic Newt Tool structure (build structure) for your application. Create your BSP (Board Support Package). In your application main() function, call the sysinit() function to initialize the system and packages, perform application specific initialization, then wait and dispatch events from the OS default event queue in an infinite loop. (See System Configuration and Initialization for more details.) Initializing application modules and tasks can get somewhat complicated with RTOS's similar to Mynewt. Care must be taken that the API provided by a task are initialized prior to being called by another (higher priority) task. For example, take a simple application with two tasks (tasks 1 and 2, with task 1 higher priority than task 2). Task 2 provides an API which has a semaphore lock and this semaphore is initialized by task 2 when the task handler for task 2 is called. Task 1 is expected to call this API. Consider the sequence of events when the OS is started. The scheduler starts running and picks the highest priority task (task 1 in this case). The task handler function for task 1 is called and will keep running until it yields execution. Before yielding, code in the task 1 handler function calls the API provided by task 2. The semaphore being accessed in the task 2 API has yet to be initialized since the task 2 handler function has not had a chance to run! This will lead to undesirable behavior and will need to be addressed by the application developer. Note that the Mynewt OS does guard against internal API being called before the OS has started (they will return error) but it does not safeguard application defined objects from access prior to initialization. Example One way to avoid initialization issues like the one described above is for the application to initialize the objects that are accessed by multiple tasks before it initializes the tasks with the OS. The code example shown below illustrates this concept. The application initializes system and packages, calls an application specific \"task initialization\" function, and dispatches events from the default event queue. The application task initialization function is responsible for initializing all the data objects that each task exposes to the other tasks. The tasks themselves are also initialized at this time (by calling os_task_init() ). In the example, each task works in a ping-pong like fashion: task 1 wakes up, adds a token to semaphore 1 and then waits for a token from semaphore 2. Task 2 waits for a token on semaphore 1 and once it gets it, adds a token to semaphore 2. Notice that the semaphores are initialized by the application specific task initialization functions and not inside the task handler functions. If task 2 (being lower in priority than task 1) had called os_sem_init() for task2_sem inside task2_handler() , task 1 would have called os_sem_pend() using task2_sem before task2_sem was initialized. struct os_sem task1_sem ; struct os_sem task2_sem ; /* Task 1 handler function */ void task1_handler ( void *arg ) { while ( 1 ) { /* Release semaphore to task 2 */ os_sem_release ( &task1_sem ); /* Wait for semaphore from task 2 */ os_sem_pend ( &task2_sem , OS_TIMEOUT_NEVER ); } } /* Task 2 handler function */ void task2_handler ( void *arg ) { struct os_task *t ; while ( 1 ) { /* Wait for semaphore from task1 */ os_sem_pend ( &task1_sem , OS_TIMEOUT_NEVER ); /* Release task2 semaphore */ os_sem_release ( &task2_sem ); } } /* Initialize task 1 exposed data objects */ void task1_init ( void ) { /* Initialize task1 semaphore */ os_sem_init ( &task1_sem , 0 ); } /* Initialize task 2 exposed data objects */ void task2_init ( void ) { /* Initialize task1 semaphore */ os_sem_init ( &task2_sem , 0 ); } /** * init_app_tasks * * This function performs initializations that are required before tasks run. * * @return int 0 success; error otherwise. */ static int init_app_tasks ( void ) { /* * Call task specific initialization functions to initialize any shared objects * before initializing the tasks with the OS. */ task1_init (); task2_init (); /* * Initialize tasks 1 and 2 with the OS. */ os_task_init ( &task1 , \"task1\" , task1_handler , NULL , TASK1_PRIO , OS_WAIT_FOREVER , task1_stack , TASK1_STACK_SIZE ); os_task_init ( &task2 , \"task2\" , task2_handler , NULL , TASK2_PRIO , OS_WAIT_FOREVER , task2_stack , TASK2_STACK_SIZE ); return 0 ; } /** * main * * The main function for the application.

Description Task states can be running , ready to run or sleeping . When a task is running , the CPU is executing in that task's context. The program counter (PC) is pointing to instructions that task wants to execute and the stack pointer (SP) is pointing to that task's stack. A task which is ready to run wants to get on the CPU to do its work. A task which is sleeping has no more work to do. It's waiting for someone or something else to wake it up. The Scheduler algorithm is simple: from among the tasks which are ready to run, pick the the one with highest priority (lowest numeric value in task's t_prio field), and make its state running . Tasks which are either running or ready to run are kept in a linked list g_os_run_list . This list is ordered by priority. Tasks which are sleeping are kept in a linked list g_os_sleep_list . The scheduler has a CPU architecture specific component; this code is responsible for swapping in the task which should be running . This process is called context switch. During context switching the state of the CPU (e.g. registers) for the currently running task is stored and the new task is swapped in.

Events are stored in a queue and a task removes and processes an event from the queue. An event is processed in the context of this task. Events may be generated by OS callouts , interrupt handlers, and other tasks. Description Mynewt's event queue model uses callback functions to process events. Each event is associated with a callback function that is called to process the event. This model enables a library package, that uses events in its implementation but does not have real-time timing requirements, to use an application event queue instead of creating a dedicated event queue and task to process its events. The callback function executes in the context of the task that the application creates to manage the event queue. This model reduces an application's memory requirement because memory must be allocated for the task's stack when a task is created. A package that has real-time timing requirements and must run at a specific task priority should create a dedicated event queue and task to process its events. In the Mynewt model, a package defines its events and implements the callback functions for the events. A package that does not have real-time timing requirements should use Mynewt's default event queue for its events. The callback function for an event from the Mynewt default event queue is executed in the context of the application main task. A package can, optionally, export a function that allows an application to specify the event queue for the package to use. (See the example in the os_eventq_designate() function description on how to write such a function.) The application task handler that manages the event queue simply pulls events from the event queue and executes the event's callback function in its context. A common way that Mynewt applications or packages process events from an event queue is to have a task that executes in an infinite loop and calls the os_eventq_get() function to dequeue and return the event from the head of the event queue. The task then calls the event callback function to process the event. The os_eventq_get() function puts the task in to the sleeping state when there are no events on the queue. (See Scheduler for more information on task execution states.) Other tasks (or interrupts) call the os_eventq_put() function to add an event to the queue. The os_eventq_put() function determines whether a task is blocked waiting for an event on the queue and puts the task into the ready-to-run state. A task can use the os_eventq_run() wrapper function that calls the os_eventq_get() function to dequeue an event from the queue and then calls the event callback function to process the event. Note: Only one task should consume or block waiting for events from an event queue. The os_callout subsystem uses events for timer expiration notification. Data structures The os_event structure defines an event and has the following fields: struct os_event { uint8_t ev_queued ; os_event_fn *ev_cb ; void *ev_arg ; STAILQ_ENTRY ( os_event ) ev_next ; }; Element Description ev_queued Internal field that indicates whether this event is currently linked to an event queue ev_cb Pointer to the callback function to call to process this event ev_arg Pointer to an optional opaque data that the callback function uses to process this event ev_next Linkage attaching this event to an event queue An event callback function has the following function prototype: typedef void os_event_fn ( struct os_event *ev ); A pointer to the os_event structure for the event is passed as an argument to the callback function.

Each event is associated with a callback function that is called to process the event. This model enables a library package, that uses events in its implementation but does not have real-time timing requirements, to use an application event queue instead of creating a dedicated event queue and task to process its events. The callback function executes in the context of the task that the application creates to manage the event queue. This model reduces an application's memory requirement because memory must be allocated for the task's stack when a task is created. A package that has real-time timing requirements and must run at a specific task priority should create a dedicated event queue and task to process its events. In the Mynewt model, a package defines its events and implements the callback functions for the events. A package that does not have real-time timing requirements should use Mynewt's default event queue for its events. The callback function for an event from the Mynewt default event queue is executed in the context of the application main task. A package can, optionally, export a function that allows an application to specify the event queue for the package to use. (See the example in the os_eventq_designate() function description on how to write such a function.) The application task handler that manages the event queue simply pulls events from the event queue and executes the event's callback function in its context. A common way that Mynewt applications or packages process events from an event queue is to have a task that executes in an infinite loop and calls the os_eventq_get() function to dequeue and return the event from the head of the event queue. The task then calls the event callback function to process the event. The os_eventq_get() function puts the task in to the sleeping state when there are no events on the queue. (See Scheduler for more information on task execution states.) Other tasks (or interrupts) call the os_eventq_put() function to add an event to the queue. The os_eventq_put() function determines whether a task is blocked waiting for an event on the queue and puts the task into the ready-to-run state. A task can use the os_eventq_run() wrapper function that calls the os_eventq_get() function to dequeue an event from the queue and then calls the event callback function to process the event. Note: Only one task should consume or block waiting for events from an event queue. The os_callout subsystem uses events for timer expiration notification.","title":"Description"},{"location":"os/core_os/event_queue/event_queue/#data-structures","text":"The os_event structure defines an event and has the following fields: struct os_event { uint8_t ev_queued ; os_event_fn *ev_cb ; void *ev_arg ; STAILQ_ENTRY ( os_event ) ev_next ; }; Element Description ev_queued Internal field that indicates whether this event is currently linked to an event queue ev_cb Pointer to the callback function to call to process this event ev_arg Pointer to an optional opaque data that the callback function uses to process this event ev_next Linkage attaching this event to an event queue An event callback function has the following function prototype: typedef void os_event_fn ( struct os_event *ev ); A pointer to the os_event structure for the event is passed as an argument to the callback function.

The mbuf is used to hold packet data as it traverses the stack. The mbuf also generally stores header information or other networking stack information that is carried around with the packet. The mbuf and its associated library of functions were developed to make common networking stack operations (like stripping and adding protocol headers) efficient and as copy-free as possible. In its simplest form, an mbuf is a memory block with some space reserved for internal information and a pointer which is used to \"chain\" memory blocks together in order to create a \"packet\". This is a very important aspect of the mbuf: the ability to chain mbufs together to create larger \"packets\" (chains of mbufs). Why use mbufs? The main reason is to conserve memory. Consider a networking protocol that generally sends small packets but occasionally sends large ones. The Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) protocol is one such example. A flat buffer would need to be sized so that the maximum packet size could be contained by the buffer. With the mbuf, a number of mbufs can be chained together so that the occasional large packet can be handled while leaving more packet buffers available to the networking stack for smaller packets. Packet Header mbuf Not all mbufs are created equal. The first mbuf in a chain of mbufs is a special mbuf called a \"packet header mbuf\". The reason that this mbuf is special is that it contains the length of all the data contained by the chain of mbufs (the packet length, in other words). The packet header mbuf may also contain a user defined structure (called a \"user header\") so that networking protocol specific information can be conveyed to various layers of the networking stack. Any mbufs that are part of the packet (i.e. in the mbuf chain but not the first one) are \"normal\" (i.e. non-packet header) mbufs. A normal mbuf does not have any packet header or user packet header structures in them; they only contain the basic mbuf header ( struct os_mbuf ). Figure 1 illustrates these two types of mbufs. Note that the numbers/text in parentheses denote the size of the structures/elements (in bytes) and that MBLEN is the memory block length of the memory pool used by the mbuf pool. Normal mbuf Now let's take a deeper dive into the mbuf structure. Figure 2 illustrates a normal mbuf and breaks out the various fields in the os_mbuf structure. The om_data field is a pointer to where the data starts inside the data buffer. Typically, mbufs that are allocated from the mbuf pool (discussed later) have their om_data pointer set to the start of the data buffer but there are cases where this may not be desirable (added a protocol header to a packet, for example). The om_flags field is a set of flags used internally by the mbuf library. Currently, no flags have been defined. The om_pkthdr_len field is the total length of all packet headers in the mbuf. For normal mbufs this is set to 0 as there is no packet or user packet headers. For packet header mbufs, this would be set to the length of the packet header structure (16) plus the size of the user packet header (if any). Note that it is this field which differentiates packet header mbufs from normal mbufs (i.e. if om_pkthdr_len is zero, this is a normal mbuf; otherwise it is a packet header mbuf). The om_len field contains the amount of user data in the data buffer. When initially allocated, this field is 0 as there is no user data in the mbuf. The omp_pool field is a pointer to the pool from which this mbuf has been allocated. This is used internally by the mbuf library. The omp_next field is a linked list element which is used to chain mbufs. Figure 2 also shows a normal mbuf with actual values in the os_mbuf structure. This mbuf starts at address 0x1000 and is 256 bytes in total length. In this example, the user has copied 33 bytes into the data buffer starting at address 0x1010 (this is where om_data points). Note that the packet header length in this mbuf is 0 as it is not a packet header mbuf. Figure 3 illustrates the packet header mbuf along with some chained mbufs (i.e a \"packet\"). In this example, the user header structure is defined to be 8 bytes. Note that in figure 3 we show a number of different mbufs with varying om_data pointers and lengths since we want to show various examples of valid mbufs. For all the mbufs (both packet header and normal ones) the total length of the memory block is 128 bytes. Mbuf pools Mbufs are collected into \"mbuf pools\" much like memory blocks. The mbuf pool itself contains a pointer to a memory pool. The memory blocks in this memory pool are the actual mbufs; both normal and packet header mbufs. Thus, the memory block (and corresponding memory pool) must be sized correctly. In other words, the memory blocks which make up the memory pool used by the mbuf pool must be at least: sizeof(struct os_mbuf) + sizeof(struct os_mbuf_pkthdr) + sizeof(struct user_defined_header) + desired minimum data buffer length . For example, if the developer wants mbufs to contain at least 64 bytes of user data and they have a user header of 12 bytes, the size of the memory block would be (at least): 64 + 12 + 16 + 8, or 100 bytes. Yes, this is a fair amount of overhead. However, the flexibility provided by the mbuf library usually outweighs overhead concerns. Create mbuf pool Creating an mbuf pool is fairly simple: create a memory pool and then create the mbuf pool using that memory pool. Once the developer has determined the size of the user data needed per mbuf (this is based on the application/networking stack and is outside the scope of this discussion) and the size of the user header (if any), the memory blocks can be sized. In the example shown below, the application requires 64 bytes of user data per mbuf and also allocates a user header (called struct user_hdr ). Note that we do not show the user header data structure as there really is no need; all we need to do is to account for it when creating the memory pool. In the example, we use the macro MBUF_PKTHDR_OVERHEAD to denote the amount of packet header overhead per mbuf and MBUF_MEMBLOCK_OVERHEAD to denote the total amount of overhead required per memory block. The macro MBUF_BUF_SIZE is used to denote the amount of payload that the application requires (aligned on a 32-bit boundary in this case). All this leads to the total memory block size required, denoted by the macro MBUF_MEMBLOCK_OVERHEAD . #define MBUF_PKTHDR_OVERHEAD sizeof(struct os_mbuf_pkthdr) + sizeof(struct user_hdr) #define MBUF_MEMBLOCK_OVERHEAD sizeof(struct os_mbuf) + MBUF_PKTHDR_OVERHEAD #define MBUF_NUM_MBUFS (32) #define MBUF_PAYLOAD_SIZE (64) #define MBUF_BUF_SIZE OS_ALIGN(MBUF_PAYLOAD_SIZE, 4) #define MBUF_MEMBLOCK_SIZE (MBUF_BUF_SIZE + MBUF_MEMBLOCK_OVERHEAD) #define MBUF_MEMPOOL_SIZE OS_MEMPOOL_SIZE(MBUF_NUM_MBUFS, MBUF_MEMBLOCK_SIZE) struct os_mbuf_pool g_mbuf_pool ; struct os_mempool g_mbuf_mempool ; os_membuf_t g_mbuf_buffer [ MBUF_MEMPOOL_SIZE ]; void create_mbuf_pool ( void ) { int rc ; rc = os_mempool_init ( &g_mbuf_mempool , MBUF_NUM_MBUFS , MBUF_MEMBLOCK_SIZE , &g_mbuf_buffer [ 0 ], \"mbuf_pool\" ); assert ( rc == 0 ); rc = os_mbuf_pool_init ( &g_mbuf_pool , &g_mbuf_mempool , MBUF_MEMBLOCK_SIZE , MBUF_NUM_MBUFS ); assert ( rc == 0 ); } Using mbufs The following examples illustrate typical mbuf usage. There are two basic mbuf allocation API: os_mbuf_get() and os_mbuf_get_pkthdr() . The first API obtains a normal mbuf whereas the latter obtains a packet header mbuf. Typically, application developers use os_mbuf_get_pkthdr() and rarely, if ever, need to call os_mbuf_get() as the rest of the mbuf API (e.g. os_mbuf_append() , os_mbuf_copyinto() , etc.) typically deal with allocating and chaining mbufs. It is recommended to use the provided API to copy data into/out of mbuf chains and/or manipulate mbufs. In example1 , the developer creates a packet and then sends the packet to a networking interface. The code sample also provides an example of copying data out of an mbuf as well as use of the \"pullup\" api (another very common mbuf api). void mbuf_usage_example1 ( uint8_t *mydata , int mydata_length ) { int rc ; struct os_mbuf *om ; /* get a packet header mbuf */ om = os_mbuf_get_pkthdr ( &g_mbuf_pool , sizeof ( struct user_hdr )); if ( om ) { /* * Copy user data into mbuf. NOTE: if mydata_length is greater than the * mbuf payload size (64 bytes using above example), mbufs are allocated * and chained together to accommodate the total packet length. */ rc = os_mbuf_copyinto ( om , 0 , mydata , len ); if ( rc ) { /* Error! Could not allocate enough mbufs for total packet length */ return - 1 ; } /* Send packet to networking interface */ send_pkt ( om ); } } In example2 we show use of the pullup api as this illustrates some of the typical pitfalls developers encounter when using mbufs. The first pitfall is one of alignment/padding. Depending on the processor and/or compiler, the sizeof() a structure may vary. Thus, the size of my_protocol_header may be different inside the packet data of the mbuf than the size of the structure on the stack or as a global variable, for instance. While some networking protcols may align protocol information on convenient processor boundaries many others try to conserve bytes \"on the air\" (i.e inside the packet data). Typical methods used to deal with this are \"packing\" the structure (i.e. force compiler to not pad) or creating protocol headers that do not require padding. example2 assumes that one of these methods was used when defining the my_protocol_header structure. Another common pitfall occurs around endianness. A network protocol may be little endian or big endian; it all depends on the protocol specification. Processors also have an endianness; this means that the developer has to be careful that the processor endianness and the protocol endianness are handled correctly. In example2 , some common networking functions are used: ntohs() and ntohl() . These are shorthand for \"network order to host order, short\" and \"network order to host order, long\". Basically, these functions convert data of a certain size (i.e. 16 bits, 32 bits, etc) to the endianness of the host. Network byte order is big-endian (most significant byte first), so these functions convert big-endian byte order to host order (thus, the implementation of these functions is host dependent). Note that the BLE networking stack \"on the air\" format is least signigicant byte first (i.e. little-endian), so a bletoh function would have to take little-endian format and convert to host format. A long story short: the developer must take care when copying structure data to/from mbufs and flat buffers! A final note: these examples assume the same mbuf struture and definitions used in the first example. void mbuf_usage_example2 ( struct mbuf *rxpkt ) { int rc ; uint8_t packet_data [ 16 ]; struct mbuf *om ; struct my_protocol_header *phdr ; /* Make sure that \"my_protocol_header\" bytes are contiguous in mbuf */ om = os_mbuf_pullup ( &g_mbuf_pool , sizeof ( struct my_protocol_header )); if ( !om ) { /* Not able to pull up data into contiguous area */ return - 1 ; } /* * Get the protocol information from the packet.

The mbuf is used to hold packet data as it traverses the stack. The mbuf also generally stores header information or other networking stack information that is carried around with the packet. The mbuf and its associated library of functions were developed to make common networking stack operations (like stripping and adding protocol headers) efficient and as copy-free as possible. In its simplest form, an mbuf is a memory block with some space reserved for internal information and a pointer which is used to \"chain\" memory blocks together in order to create a \"packet\". This is a very important aspect of the mbuf: the ability to chain mbufs together to create larger \"packets\" (chains of mbufs).","title":"Mbufs"},{"location":"os/core_os/mbuf/mbuf/#why-use-mbufs","text":"The main reason is to conserve memory. Consider a networking protocol that generally sends small packets but occasionally sends large ones. The Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) protocol is one such example. A flat buffer would need to be sized so that the maximum packet size could be contained by the buffer. With the mbuf, a number of mbufs can be chained together so that the occasional large packet can be handled while leaving more packet buffers available to the networking stack for smaller packets.","title":"Why use mbufs?"},{"location":"os/core_os/mbuf/mbuf/#packet-header-mbuf","text":"Not all mbufs are created equal. The first mbuf in a chain of mbufs is a special mbuf called a \"packet header mbuf\". The reason that this mbuf is special is that it contains the length of all the data contained by the chain of mbufs (the packet length, in other words). The packet header mbuf may also contain a user defined structure (called a \"user header\") so that networking protocol specific information can be conveyed to various layers of the networking stack. Any mbufs that are part of the packet (i.e. in the mbuf chain but not the first one) are \"normal\" (i.e. non-packet header) mbufs. A normal mbuf does not have any packet header or user packet header structures in them; they only contain the basic mbuf header ( struct os_mbuf ). Figure 1 illustrates these two types of mbufs. Note that the numbers/text in parentheses denote the size of the structures/elements (in bytes) and that MBLEN is the memory block length of the memory pool used by the mbuf pool.","title":"Packet Header mbuf"},{"location":"os/core_os/mbuf/mbuf/#normal-mbuf","text":"Now let's take a deeper dive into the mbuf structure. Figure 2 illustrates a normal mbuf and breaks out the various fields in the os_mbuf structure. The om_data field is a pointer to where the data starts inside the data buffer. Typically, mbufs that are allocated from the mbuf pool (discussed later) have their om_data pointer set to the start of the data buffer but there are cases where this may not be desirable (added a protocol header to a packet, for example). The om_flags field is a set of flags used internally by the mbuf library. Currently, no flags have been defined. The om_pkthdr_len field is the total length of all packet headers in the mbuf. For normal mbufs this is set to 0 as there is no packet or user packet headers. For packet header mbufs, this would be set to the length of the packet header structure (16) plus the size of the user packet header (if any). Note that it is this field which differentiates packet header mbufs from normal mbufs (i.e. if om_pkthdr_len is zero, this is a normal mbuf; otherwise it is a packet header mbuf). The om_len field contains the amount of user data in the data buffer. When initially allocated, this field is 0 as there is no user data in the mbuf. The omp_pool field is a pointer to the pool from which this mbuf has been allocated. This is used internally by the mbuf library. The omp_next field is a linked list element which is used to chain mbufs. Figure 2 also shows a normal mbuf with actual values in the os_mbuf structure. This mbuf starts at address 0x1000 and is 256 bytes in total length. In this example, the user has copied 33 bytes into the data buffer starting at address 0x1010 (this is where om_data points). Note that the packet header length in this mbuf is 0 as it is not a packet header mbuf. Figure 3 illustrates the packet header mbuf along with some chained mbufs (i.e a \"packet\"). In this example, the user header structure is defined to be 8 bytes. Note that in figure 3 we show a number of different mbufs with varying om_data pointers and lengths since we want to show various examples of valid mbufs. For all the mbufs (both packet header and normal ones) the total length of the memory block is 128 bytes.","title":"Normal mbuf"},{"location":"os/core_os/mbuf/mbuf/#mbuf-pools","text":"Mbufs are collected into \"mbuf pools\" much like memory blocks. The mbuf pool itself contains a pointer to a memory pool. The memory blocks in this memory pool are the actual mbufs; both normal and packet header mbufs. Thus, the memory block (and corresponding memory pool) must be sized correctly. In other words, the memory blocks which make up the memory pool used by the mbuf pool must be at least: sizeof(struct os_mbuf) + sizeof(struct os_mbuf_pkthdr) + sizeof(struct user_defined_header) + desired minimum data buffer length . For example, if the developer wants mbufs to contain at least 64 bytes of user data and they have a user header of 12 bytes, the size of the memory block would be (at least): 64 + 12 + 16 + 8, or 100 bytes. Yes, this is a fair amount of overhead. However, the flexibility provided by the mbuf library usually outweighs overhead concerns.","title":"Mbuf pools"},{"location":"os/core_os/mbuf/mbuf/#create-mbuf-pool","text":"Creating an mbuf pool is fairly simple: create a memory pool and then create the mbuf pool using that memory pool. Once the developer has determined the size of the user data needed per mbuf (this is based on the application/networking stack and is outside the scope of this discussion) and the size of the user header (if any), the memory blocks can be sized. In the example shown below, the application requires 64 bytes of user data per mbuf and also allocates a user header (called struct user_hdr ). Note that we do not show the user header data structure as there really is no need; all we need to do is to account for it when creating the memory pool. In the example, we use the macro MBUF_PKTHDR_OVERHEAD to denote the amount of packet header overhead per mbuf and MBUF_MEMBLOCK_OVERHEAD to denote the total amount of overhead required per memory block. The macro MBUF_BUF_SIZE is used to denote the amount of payload that the application requires (aligned on a 32-bit boundary in this case).

There are two basic mbuf allocation API: os_mbuf_get() and os_mbuf_get_pkthdr() . The first API obtains a normal mbuf whereas the latter obtains a packet header mbuf. Typically, application developers use os_mbuf_get_pkthdr() and rarely, if ever, need to call os_mbuf_get() as the rest of the mbuf API (e.g. os_mbuf_append() , os_mbuf_copyinto() , etc.) typically deal with allocating and chaining mbufs. It is recommended to use the provided API to copy data into/out of mbuf chains and/or manipulate mbufs. In example1 , the developer creates a packet and then sends the packet to a networking interface. The code sample also provides an example of copying data out of an mbuf as well as use of the \"pullup\" api (another very common mbuf api). void mbuf_usage_example1 ( uint8_t *mydata , int mydata_length ) { int rc ; struct os_mbuf *om ; /* get a packet header mbuf */ om = os_mbuf_get_pkthdr ( &g_mbuf_pool , sizeof ( struct user_hdr )); if ( om ) { /* * Copy user data into mbuf. NOTE: if mydata_length is greater than the * mbuf payload size (64 bytes using above example), mbufs are allocated * and chained together to accommodate the total packet length. */ rc = os_mbuf_copyinto ( om , 0 , mydata , len ); if ( rc ) { /* Error! Could not allocate enough mbufs for total packet length */ return - 1 ; } /* Send packet to networking interface */ send_pkt ( om ); } } In example2 we show use of the pullup api as this illustrates some of the typical pitfalls developers encounter when using mbufs. The first pitfall is one of alignment/padding. Depending on the processor and/or compiler, the sizeof() a structure may vary. Thus, the size of my_protocol_header may be different inside the packet data of the mbuf than the size of the structure on the stack or as a global variable, for instance. While some networking protcols may align protocol information on convenient processor boundaries many others try to conserve bytes \"on the air\" (i.e inside the packet data). Typical methods used to deal with this are \"packing\" the structure (i.e. force compiler to not pad) or creating protocol headers that do not require padding. example2 assumes that one of these methods was used when defining the my_protocol_header structure. Another common pitfall occurs around endianness. A network protocol may be little endian or big endian; it all depends on the protocol specification. Processors also have an endianness; this means that the developer has to be careful that the processor endianness and the protocol endianness are handled correctly. In example2 , some common networking functions are used: ntohs() and ntohl() . These are shorthand for \"network order to host order, short\" and \"network order to host order, long\". Basically, these functions convert data of a certain size (i.e. 16 bits, 32 bits, etc) to the endianness of the host. Network byte order is big-endian (most significant byte first), so these functions convert big-endian byte order to host order (thus, the implementation of these functions is host dependent). Note that the BLE networking stack \"on the air\" format is least signigicant byte first (i.e. little-endian), so a bletoh function would have to take little-endian format and convert to host format. A long story short: the developer must take care when copying structure data to/from mbufs and flat buffers! A final note: these examples assume the same mbuf struture and definitions used in the first example. void mbuf_usage_example2 ( struct mbuf *rxpkt ) { int rc ; uint8_t packet_data [ 16 ]; struct mbuf *om ; struct my_protocol_header *phdr ; /* Make sure that \"my_protocol_header\" bytes are contiguous in mbuf */ om = os_mbuf_pullup ( &g_mbuf_pool , sizeof ( struct my_protocol_header )); if ( !om ) { /* Not able to pull up data into contiguous area */ return - 1 ; } /* * Get the protocol information from the packet.

Generally, memory pools are used when the developer wants to allocate a certain amount of memory to a given feature. Unlike the heap, where a code module is at the mercy of other code modules to insure there is sufficient memory, memory pools can insure sufficient memory allocation. Description In order to create a memory pool the developer needs to do a few things. The first task is to define the memory pool itself. This is a data structure which contains information about the pool itself (i.e. number of blocks, size of the blocks, etc). struct os_mempool my_pool ; The next order of business is to allocate the memory used by the memory pool. This memory can either be statically allocated (i.e. a global variable) or dynamically allocated (i.e. from the heap). When determining the amount of memory required for the memory pool, simply multiplying the number of blocks by the size of each block is not sufficient as the OS may have alignment requirements. The alignment size definition is named OS_ALIGNMENT and can be found in os_arch.h as it is architecture specific. The memory block alignment is usually for efficiency but may be due to other reasons. Generally, blocks are aligned on 32-bit boundaries. Note that memory blocks must also be of sufficient size to hold a list pointer as this is needed to chain memory blocks on the free list. In order to simplify this for the user two macros have been provided: OS_MEMPOOL_BYTES(n, blksize) and OS_MEMPOOL_SIZE(n, blksize) .

The application then allocates mbufs using the msys API (as opposed to the mbuf API). The msys code will choose the mbuf pool with the smallest mbufs that can accommodate the requested size. Let us walk through an example where the user registers three mbuf pools with msys: one with 32 byte mbufs, one with 256 and one with 2048. If the user requests an mbuf with 10 bytes, the 32-byte mbuf pool is used. If the request is for 33 bytes the 256 byte mbuf pool is used. If an mbuf data size is requested that is larger than any of the pools (say, 4000 bytes) the largest pool is used. While this behaviour may not be optimal in all cases that is the currently implemented behaviour. All this means is that the user is not guaranteed that a single mbuf can hold the requested data. The msys code will not allocate an mbuf from a larger pool if the chosen mbuf pool is empty.

A mutex provides priority inheritance in order to prevent priority inversion . Priority inversion occurs when a higher priority task is waiting on a resource owned by a lower priority task. Using a mutex, the lower priority task will inherit the highest priority of any task waiting on the mutex. Description The first order of business when using a mutex is to declare the mutex globally. The mutex needs to be initialized before it is used (see the examples). It is generally a good idea to initialize the mutex before tasks start running in order to avoid a task possibly using the mutex before it is initialized. When a task wants exclusive access to a shared resource it needs to obtain the mutex by calling os_mutex_pend . If the mutex is currently owned by a different task (a lower priority task), the requesting task will be put to sleep and the owners priority will be elevated to the priority of the requesting task. Note that multiple tasks can request ownership and the current owner is elevated to the highest priority of any task waitin on the mutex. When the task is done using the shared resource, it needs to release the mutex by called os_mutex_release . There needs to be one release per call to pend. Note that nested calls to os_mutex_pend are allowed but there needs to be one release per pend. The following example will illustrate how priority inheritance works. In this example, the task number is the same as its priority. Remember that the lower the number, the higher the priority (i.e. priority 0 is higher priority than priority 1). Suppose that task 5 gets ownership of a mutex but is preempted by task 4. Task 4 attempts to gain ownership of the mutex but cannot as it is owned by task 5. Task 4 is put to sleep and task 5 is temporarily raised to priority 4. Before task 5 can release the mutex, task 3 runs and attempts to acquire the mutex. At this point, both task 3 and task 4 are waiting on the mutex (sleeping). Task 5 now runs at priority 3 (the highest priority of all the tasks waiting on the mutex). When task 5 finally releases the mutex it will be preempted as two higher priority tasks are waiting for it.

If another similar BSP exists it is recommended to copy that BSP as a starting point. For example, if another BSP exists using the same MCU, start with a copy of that BSP. Either way, this document describes the steps necessary to create a new BSP from scratch. Keep your Reference Documents handy To build a proper BSP, you will typically need the following: The datasheet for the MCU you have chosen The schematic of your board The information on the CPU core within your MCU if it is not included in your MCU documentation This Mynewt documentation Name your BSP Select a name for your BSP. For the remainder of this document, we'll assume the bsp is named myboard . In general its best to select a name that describes the board/system you are creating. Create a BSP directory Create a directory hw/bsp/myboard using the name chosen above. Within this BSP directory, create the following subdirectories: include include/bsp src Create a Target using Mynewt Create a newt target for your test project for the BSP. To learn how to create a target, see this howto Tutorial . Once you are familiar with creating targets, move on below to create a target to use to test your BSP. It is recommended that you use a simple project like blinky to minimize the time to get a working Mynewt system. For this document, we will assume the target is called myboard_blinky and uses project blinky . Set the bsp of the project to /hw/bsp/myboard . While creating your target, you will need to specify your arch and compiler . If your platform requires an architecture or compiler that are not defined in Mynewt, you will need to add them first. To add a CPU architecture see CPU Porting . When this is complete, your target may look similar to this. $ newt target show myboard_blinky arch=cortex_m0 bsp=hw/bsp/myboard compiler=arm-none-eabi-m0 compiler_def=debug name=myboard_blinky project=blinky Create Required Files For Compilation Create the following files within the BSP directory tree. For now, they can be empty files. We will fill them out one at a time. File Path Name Description LICENSE A File to present the source license for your BSP README.md A markdown file to write documentation for your BSP pkg.yml A package file to describe your BSP contents include/bsp/bsp.h A header file to include definitions required by system from the BSP include/bsp/bsp_sysid.h A header file to enumerate the devices in your BSP src/os_bsp.c A C source file to provide functions required by the OS from your BSP src/sbrk.c A C source file to memory from your heap to the OS src/libc_stubs.c A C source file to provide stubs/methods required by libc myboard.ld A linker script to provide the memory map for your linked code Optionally, create these files as necessary to provide all functionality from Mynewt. File Path Name Description myboard_boot.ld A linker script to provide the memory map for your bootloader myboard_download.sh A bash script to download code into your platform myboard_debug.sh A bash script to intiate a gdb session with your platform src/hal_bsp.c A C source file to provide functions required by the HAL from your BSP Fill Out your Package File Edit the package file to describe your BSP. The package file must contain: pkg.name: \"hw/bsp/myboard\" pkg.linkerscript: \"myboard.ld\" Attribute Description pkg.name The name of your bsp package pkg.linkerscript The linker script that controls the memory placement of the compiled code sections from the Mynewt OS and your applications. The linker script is a key component of the BSP and specifies where each section of code and data are stored within your CPU which can vary with the BSP depending on your chosen memory layout. For a tutorial on writing linker scripts, see Create or Copy Linker Script(s) . The package file typically contains: pkg.linkerscript.bootloader.OVERWRITE: \"myboard_boot.ld\" pkg.downloadscript: \"myboard_download.sh\" pkg.debugscript: \"myboard_debug.sh\" pkg.deps: - hw/mcu/mymcu/variant where mymcu/variant should be replaced with the specific MCU and variant used in your design. The following table describes additional attributes relevant to the BSP pkg.yml file. Attribute Description pkg.linkerscript.bootloader.OVERWRITE A special linker for creating a bootloader for Mynewt pkg.downloadscript A script that can download a flash image into your target platform pkg.debugscript A script that can run the GDB debugger on your board pkg.deps Any dependencies on your BSP The BSP will invariably depend upon an MCU (in this sample it's hw/mcu/mymcu/variant ) since the Mynewt OS runs on an MCU within your target. If your MCU is not supported by Mynewt, see MCU Porting for details on how to create a new MCU in Mynewt. The package file may also contain: pkg.cflags: -D__MY_SPECIAL_BSP_OPTIONS_ pkg.deps: - libs/cmsis-core Attribute Description pkg.cflags Any specific compiler flags for your bsp pkg.deps Any other libraries that may be required. Some architectures (like ARM) have special libraries to make BSP creation easier. Create or Copy Linker Script It's probably best to start with a linker script from another BSP using the same MCU. If this is not available, consult your MCU documentation and library samples to find a linker script to start with. Typically, a linker script has to specify the following sections for code: .text -- the location and alignment of the memory section to store your code .data -- the location and alignment of the memory section to store initialized data .bss -- the location and alignment of the memory section to store uninitialized data .heap -- the location and alignment of the memory section to provide system memory The linker script should specify the location and size of the different memory regions in your BSP and map the code sections described above into these regions. The linker script should also include an ENTRY point. This is used by the debugger to know where to start the program counter when the target is debugged. There may be additional requirements from the MCU or OS that you may find easiest to place in the linker script. Some specific variables that the OS and MCU depends on are : Variable Description __bss_start__ a variable located at the start of the BSS section __bss_end__ a variable located at the end of the BSS section __isr_vector Some CPUs map their interrupt vectors. They may need to be specified in the linker _user_heap_start the start of the heap for unallocated memory _user_heap_end the end of the heap for unallocated memory Create an alternate linker script for the bootloader since it is typically linked to use different addresses to boot the main image. Add Functions and Defines At this point, it will be possible to run the newt tool to build your target. You may run into complaints from the linker script that a few Mynewt specific functions are missing. We will describe these below. Function Description os_bsp_init() code to initialize the bsp os_bsp_systick_init() code to setup the system tick for the OS There are also several libc definitions that can be stubbed in your first BSP. Examples are _write , _read , etc. that can be found in libc_stubs.c . But you must implement the following function to provide memory to the OS and system. Function Description _sbrk Returns memory from heap (used by malloc) Implement _sbrk() sbrk() is required by libc to get memory from the heap for things like malloc. Although not strongly BSP dependent, this is currently in the BSP to allow flexibility in providing system memory. See other BSPs for providing sbrk functionality. Implement os_bsp_init() os_bsp_init should initialize anything required in the OS by the BSP. Typically this is a very small set. NOTE : Currently we are making calls to _sbrk() and close(0) from os_bsp_init to get around a linker issue where some of libc is not getting included. Please include this in your os_bsp_init . /* * XXX these references are here to keep the functions in for libc to find. */ _sbrk ( 0 ); _close ( 0 ); Other Unresolved Defines or Functions There may be other unresolved defines or functions that are required by the specific MCU within your BSP. Below lists some sample defines. Undefined Variable Description CONSOLE_UART_PORT Which communications port on your target runs the console LED_BLINK_PIN which pin on your target runs the blinky LED The set of missing functionality depends upon the libraries and dependencies you have included in the project. That's why its best to keep your first project pretty simple then add incrementally. For example, if you include the Newtron file system, you will need to define a file system map for your BSP. Missing functionality may take the form of #define items required to compile, or they may take the form of missing functions. cmsis_nvic.h If you are using an ARM cortex architecture, you need to define the number of interrupts supported by your system. If you are not using ARM Cortex architecture this may not be required (but something else might be). Add Debug Script The debug script in the bsp directory allows the newt tool to automatically connect to the debugger and create a debug session with the target. This requires knowledge of your target debug interface. Most of the Mynewt BSP targets use openocd to perform debugging. This script typically creates an openocd connection to the target and then connects a gdb instance to this openocd connection. There are several examples in existing BSPs to follow. The script must take a single argument which is the name of the image file minus the '.elf' suffix. The BSP is complete without this file, but newt will be unable to establish a debug session without it. Add Download Script Similar to the debug script, the download script is a hook for newt to download the image to the target system. The download script also typically uses the openocd interface to erase flash and progam the code into the device. NOTE: The download script needs to command openocd to program the image into the appropriate location which is typically called FLASH_OFFSET in these scripts. This location has to match the linker script location of the image link address. For example, if your linker links the code to be run at 0xC000 your download script should download the image to the same address in the correct flash.

Description The Mynewt OS is a complete multi-tasking environment with scheduler, time control, buffer management, and synchronization objects. it also includes libraries and services like console, command shell, image manager, bootloader, and file systems etc. Thee majority of this software is platform independent and requires no intervention to run on your platform, but some of the components require support from the underlying platform. The platform dependency of these components can fall into several categories: CPU Core Dependencies -- Specific code or configuration to operate the CPU core within your target platform MCU Dependencies -- Specific code or configuration to operate the MCU or SoC within your target platform BSP Dependencies -- Specific code or configuration to accommodate the specific layout and functionality of your target platform Board Support Package (BSP) Dependency With all of the functionality provided by the core, MCU, and MCU HAL (Hardware Abstraction Layer), there are still some things that must be specified for your particular system. This is provided in Mynewt to allow you the flexibility to design for the exact functionality, peripherals and features that you require in your product. In Mynewt, these settings/components are included in a Board Support Package (BSP). The BSP contains the information specific to running Mynewt on a target platform or hardware board. Mynewt supports some common open source hardware as well as the development boards for some common MCUs. These development systems might be enough for you to get your prototype up and running, but when building a product you are likely going to have your own board which is slightly different from those already supported by Mynewt. For example, you might decide on your system that 16 Kilobytes of flash space in one flash device is reserved for a flash file system. Or on your system you may decide that GPIO pin 5 of the MCU is connected to the system LED. Or you may decide that the OS Tick (the underlying time source for the OS) should run slower than the defaults to conserve battery power. These types of behaviors are specified in the BSP. The information provided in the BSP (what you need to specify to get a complete executable) can vary depending on the MCU and its underlying core architecture. For example, some MCUs have dedicated pins for UART, SPI etc, so there is no configuration required in the BSP when using these peripherals. However some MCUs have a pin multiplexor that allows the UART to be mapped to several different pins. For these MCUs, the BSP must specify if and where the UART pins should appear to match the hardware layout of your system. If your BSP is already supported my Mynewt, there is no additional BSP work involved in porting to your platform. You need only set the bsp attribute in your Mynewt target using the newt command tool . If your BSP is not yet supported by Mynewt, you can add support by following the instructions on how to add BSP support to Mynewt MCU Dependency Some OS code depends on the MCU or SoC that the system contains. For example, the MCU may specify the potential memory map of the system - where code and data can reside.

The platform dependency of these components can fall into several categories: CPU Core Dependencies -- Specific code or configuration to operate the CPU core within your target platform MCU Dependencies -- Specific code or configuration to operate the MCU or SoC within your target platform BSP Dependencies -- Specific code or configuration to accommodate the specific layout and functionality of your target platform","title":"Description"},{"location":"os/core_os/porting/port_os/#board-support-package-bsp-dependency","text":"With all of the functionality provided by the core, MCU, and MCU HAL (Hardware Abstraction Layer), there are still some things that must be specified for your particular system. This is provided in Mynewt to allow you the flexibility to design for the exact functionality, peripherals and features that you require in your product. In Mynewt, these settings/components are included in a Board Support Package (BSP). The BSP contains the information specific to running Mynewt on a target platform or hardware board. Mynewt supports some common open source hardware as well as the development boards for some common MCUs. These development systems might be enough for you to get your prototype up and running, but when building a product you are likely going to have your own board which is slightly different from those already supported by Mynewt. For example, you might decide on your system that 16 Kilobytes of flash space in one flash device is reserved for a flash file system. Or on your system you may decide that GPIO pin 5 of the MCU is connected to the system LED. Or you may decide that the OS Tick (the underlying time source for the OS) should run slower than the defaults to conserve battery power. These types of behaviors are specified in the BSP. The information provided in the BSP (what you need to specify to get a complete executable) can vary depending on the MCU and its underlying core architecture. For example, some MCUs have dedicated pins for UART, SPI etc, so there is no configuration required in the BSP when using these peripherals. However some MCUs have a pin multiplexor that allows the UART to be mapped to several different pins. For these MCUs, the BSP must specify if and where the UART pins should appear to match the hardware layout of your system. If your BSP is already supported my Mynewt, there is no additional BSP work involved in porting to your platform.

In a typical system design, there are multiple stages of watchdog: Internal Watchdog External Watchdog Sanity Watchdog The Internal Watchdog is typically an MCU watchdog, which is tickled in the core of the OS. The internal watchdog is tickled frequently, and is meant to be an indicator the OS is running. The External Watchdog is a watchdog that's typically run slower. The purpose of an external watchdog is to provide the system with a hard reset when it has lost its mind. The Sanity Watchdog is the least frequently run watchdog, and is meant as an application watchdog. This document is about the operation of the Mynewt Sanity Watchdog. Description Initializing the Sanity Task The Sanity Watchdog is a task in the Mynewt OS, which when enabled, runs every sanity_seconds . In order to enable the Sanity Watchdog task, call the os_sanity_task_init() function. int os_sanity_task_init ( int sanity_seconds ); By default, every operating system task provides the frequency it will check in with the sanity task, with the sanity_itvl parameter in the os_task_init() function: int os_task_init ( struct os_task *t , char *name , os_task_func_t func , void *arg , uint8_t prio , os_time_t sanity_itvl , os_stack_t *bottom , uint16_t stack_size ); sanity_itvl is the time in OS time ticks that the task being created must register in with the sanity task. Checking in with Sanity Task The task must then register in with the sanity task every sanity_itvl seconds. In order to do that, the task should call the os_sanity_task_checkin function, which will reset the sanity check associated with this task. Here is an example of a task that uses a callout to checkin with the sanity task every 50 seconds: #define TASK1_SANITY_CHECKIN_ITVL (50 * OS_TICKS_PER_SEC) struct os_eventq task1_evq ; static void task1 ( void *arg ) { struct os_task *t ; struct os_event *ev ; struct os_callout c ; /* Get current OS task */ t = os_sched_get_current_task (); /* Initialize the event queue. */ os_eventq_init ( &task1_evq ); /* Initialize the callout */ os_callout_init ( &c , &task1_evq , NULL ); /* reset the callout to checkin with the sanity task * in 50 seconds to kick off timing. */ os_callout_reset ( &c , TASK1_SANITY_CHECKIN_ITVL ); while ( 1 ) { ev = os_eventq_get ( &task1_evq ); /* The sanity timer has reset */ if ( ev->ev_arg == &c ) { os_sanity_task_checkin ( t ); } else { /* not expecting any other events */ assert ( 0 ); } } /* Should never reach */ assert ( 0 ); } Registering a Custom Sanity Check If a particular task wants to further hook into the sanity framework to perform other checks during the sanity task's operation, it can do so by registering a struct os_sanity_check using the os_sanity_check_register function. static int mymodule_perform_sanity_check ( struct os_sanity_check *sc , void *arg ) { /* Perform your checking here. In this case, we check if there * are available buffers in mymodule, and return 0 (all good) * if true, and -1 (error) if not. */ if ( mymodule_has_buffers ()) { return ( 0 ); } else { return ( - 1 ); } } static int mymodule_register_sanity_check ( void ) { struct os_sanity_check sc ; os_sanity_check_init ( &sc ); /* Only assert() if mymodule_perform_sanity_check() fails 50 * times. SANITY_TASK_INTERVAL is defined by the user, and * is the frequency at which the sanity_task runs in seconds. */ OS_SANITY_CHECK_SETFUNC ( &sc , mymodule_perform_sanity_check , NULL , 50 * SANITY_TASK_INTERVAL ); rc = os_sanity_check_register ( &sc ); if ( rc != 0 ) { goto err ; } return ( 0 ); err : return ( rc ); } In the above example, every time the custom sanity check mymodule_perform_sanity_check returns successfully (0), the sanity check is reset. In the OS_SANITY_CHECK_SETFUNC macro, the sanity checkin interval is specified as 50 * SANITY_TASK_INTERVAL (which is the interval at which the sanity task runs.) This means that the mymodule_perform_sanity_check() function needs to fail 50 times consecutively before the sanity task will crash the system. TIP: When checking things like memory buffers, which can be temporarily be exhausted, it's a good idea to have the sanity check fail multiple consecutive times before crashing the system. This will avoid crashing for temporary failures.

Semaphores like the ones used by the Mynewt OS are called \"counting\" semaphores as they are allowed to have more than one token (explained below). Description A semaphore is a fairly simple construct consisting of a queue for waiting tasks and the number of tokens currently owned by the semaphore. A semaphore can be obtained as long as there are tokens in the semaphore. Any task can add tokens to the semaphore and any task can request the semaphore, thereby removing tokens. When creating the semaphore, the initial number of tokens can be set as well. When used for exclusive access to a shared resource the semaphore only needs a single token. In this case, a single task \"creates\" the semaphore by calling os_sem_init with a value of one (1) for the token. When a task desires exclusive access to the shared resource it requests the semaphore by calling os_sem_pend . If there is a token the requesting task will acquire the semaphore and continue operation. If no tokens are available the task will be put to sleep until there is a token. A common problem with using a semaphore for exclusive access is called priority inversion . Consider the following scenario: a high and low priority task both share a resource which is locked using a semaphore. If the low priority task obtains the semaphore and then the high priority task requests the semaphore, the high priority task is now blocked until the low priority task releases the semaphore. Now suppose that there are tasks between the low priority task and the high priority task that want to run. These tasks will preempt the low priority task which owns the semaphore. Thus, the high priority task is blocked waiting for the low priority task to finish using the semaphore but the low priority task cannot run since other tasks are running. Thus, the high priority tasks is \"inverted\" in priority; in effect running at a much lower priority as normally it would preempt the other (lower priority) tasks. If this is an issue a mutex should be used instead of a semaphore. Semaphores can also be used for task synchronization. A simple example of this would be the following. A task creates a semaphore and initializes it with no tokens. The task then waits on the semaphore, and since there are no tokens, the task is put to sleep. When other tasks want to wake up the sleeping task they simply add a token by calling os_sem_release . This will cause the sleeping task to wake up (instantly if no other higher priority tasks want to run). The other common use of a counting semaphore is in what is commonly called a \"producer/consumer\" relationship. The producer adds tokens (by calling os_sem_release ) and the consumer consumes them by calling os_sem_pend . In this relationship, the producer has work for the consumer to do. Each token added to the semaphore will cause the consumer to do whatever work is required. A simple example could be the following: every time a button is pressed there is some work to do (ring a bell). Each button press causes the producer to add a token. Each token consumed rings the bell. There will be exactly the same number of bell rings as there are button presses. In other words, each call to os_sem_pend subtracts exactly one token and each call to os_sem_release adds exactly one token.

A task consists of two basic elements: a task stack and a task function. The task function is basically a forever loop, waiting for some \"event\" to wake it up. There are two methods used to signal a task that it has work to do: event queues and semaphores . The Mynewt OS is a multi-tasking, preemptive OS. Every task is assigned a task priority (from 0 to 255), with 0 being the highest priority task. If a higher priority task than the current task wants to run, the scheduler preempts the currently running task and switches context to the higher priority task. This is just a fancy way of saying that the processor stack pointer now points to the stack of the higher priority task and the task resumes execution where it left off. Tasks run to completion unless they are preempted by a higher priority task. The developer must ensure that tasks eventually \"sleep\"; otherwise lower priority tasks will never get a chance to run (actually, any task lower in priority than the task that never sleeps). A task will be put to sleep in the following cases: it puts itself to sleep using os_time_delay() , it waits on an event queue which is empty or attempts to obtain a mutex or a semaphore that is currently owned by another task. Note that other sections of the manual describe these OS features in more detail. Description In order to create a task two data structures need to be defined: the task object ( struct os_task ) and its associated stack. Determining the stack size can be a bit tricky; generally developers should not declare large local variables on the stack so that task stacks can be of limited size. However, all applications are different and the developer must choose the stack size accordingly. NOTE: be careful when declaring your stack! The stack is in units of os_stack_t sized elements (generally 32-bits). Looking at the example given below and assuming os_stack_t is defined to be a 32-bit unsigned value, \"my_task_stack\" will use 256 bytes. A task must also have an associated \"task function\". This is the function that will be called when the task is first run. This task function should never return! In order to inform the Mynewt OS of the new task and to have it added to the scheduler, the os_task_init() function is called. Once os_task_init() is called, the task is made ready to run and is added to the active task list. Note that a task can be initialized (started) before or after the os has started (i.e. before os_start() is called) but must be initialized after the os has been initialized (i.e. 'os_init()' has been called). In most of the examples and current Mynewt projects, the os is initialized, tasks are initialized, and the the os is started. Once the os has started, the highest priority task will be the first task set to run. Information about a task can be obtained using the os_task_info_get_next() API. Developers can walk the list of tasks to obtain information on all created tasks. This information is of type os_task_info and is described below.

Description The Mynewt OS contains an incrementing time that drives the OS scheduler and time delays. The time is a fixed size (e.g. 32 bits) and will eventually wrap back to zero. The time to wrap from zero back to zero is called the OS time epoch . The frequency of the OS time tick is specified in the architecture-specific OS code os_arch.h and is named OS_TICKS_PER_SEC . The Mynewt OS also provides APIs for setting and retrieving the wallclock time (also known as local time or time-of-day in other operating systems). Data Structures Time is stored in Mynewt as an os_time_t value. Wallclock time is represented using the struct os_timeval and struct os_timezone tuple. struct os_timeval represents the number of seconds elapsed since the epoch (00:00:00 Jan 1, 1970 UTC). struct os_timeval { int64_t tv_sec ; /* seconds since Jan 1 1970 UTC */ int32_t tv_usec ; /* fractional seconds */ }; struct os_timeval tv = { 1457400000 , 0 }; /* 01:20:00 Mar 8 2016 UTC */ struct os_timezone is used to specify the offset of local time from UTC and whether daylight savings is in effect. Note that tz_minuteswest is a positive number if the local time is behind UTC and a negative number if the local time is ahead of UTC. struct os_timezone { int16_t tz_minuteswest ; int16_t tz_dsttime ; }; /* Pacific Standard Time is 08:00 hours west of UTC */ struct os_timezone PST = { 480 , 0 }; struct os_timezone PDT = { 480 , 1 }; /* Indian Standard Time is 05:30 hours east of UTC */ struct os_timezone IST = { - 330 , 0 }; List of Functions The functions available in time are: Function Description os_time_advance Increments the OS time tick for the system. os_time_delay Put the current task to sleep for the given number of ticks. os_time_get Get the current value of OS time. os_time_ms_to_ticks Converts milliseconds to os ticks. os_get_uptime_usec Gets the time duration since boot. os_gettimeofday Populate the given timeval and timezone structs with current time data. os_settimeofday Set the current time of day to the given time structs. List of Macros Several macros help with the evalution of times with respect to each other. OS_TIME_TICK_LT(t1,t2) -- evaluates to true if t1 is before t2 in time. OS_TIME_TICK_GT(t1,t2) -- evaluates to true if t1 is after t2 in time OS_TIME_TICK_GEQ(t1,t2) -- evaluates to true if t1 is on or after t2 in time. NOTE: For all of these macros the calculations are done modulo 'os_time_t'. Ensure that comparison of OS time always uses the macros above (to compensate for the possible wrap of OS time). The following macros help adding or subtracting time when represented as struct os_timeval . All parameters to the following macros are pointers to struct os_timeval . os_timeradd(tvp, uvp, vvp) -- Add uvp to tvp and store result in vvp . os_timersub(tvp, uvp, vvp) -- Subtract uvp from tvp and store result in vvp . Special Notes Its important to understand how quickly the time wraps especially when doing time comparison using the macros above (or by any other means). For example, if a tick is 1 millisecond and os_time_t is 32-bits the OS time will wrap back to zero in about 49.7 days or stated another way, the OS time epoch is 49.7 days. If two times are more than 1/2 the OS time epoch apart, any time comparison will be incorrect. Ensure at design time that comparisons will not occur between times that are more than half the OS time epoch.","title":"toc"},{"location":"os/core_os/time/os_time/#os_time","text":"The system time for the Mynewt OS.","title":"OS_Time"},{"location":"os/core_os/time/os_time/#description","text":"The Mynewt OS contains an incrementing time that drives the OS scheduler and time delays.

The newt command line tool and the entire build toolchain is available in a single docker container. The container is all that's needed to run your Mynewt based application in the simulator. Enabling USB2 with your docker installation will allow you to load your application on a supported device. Docker is the only supported option if you are working on a Windows machine. If you are using Mac OS X or Linux, you have the choice of installing a Docker container of tools and toolchains or installing them natively. This chapter describes how to set up the Docker image for all three platforms. Install Docker Install docker for your platform. Mac OS X / Windows / Linux Mac and Windows Mac and Windows require Docker Toolbox to interact with USB devices. Docker for Mac and Docker for Windows do not support USB. Docker Toolbox uses VirtualBox and allows you to map USB devices into docker containers as described below. Make sure to double click the Docker Quickstart Terminal application if you're on Mac or Windows. Linux The docker daemon listens on a Unix domain socket on Linux. That socket is owned by root, which means by default you must be root to start a container. Make sure to follow the optional step of adding yourself to the docker group so you can start the newt container as yourself. Use the newt wrapper script Use the newt wrapper script to invoke newt. Create the following file, name it newt , make it executable, and put it in your path. This will allow you to run newt as if it was natively installed. You can now follow the normal tutorials using the newt wrapper script. #!/bin/bash if [ \" $1 \" = \"debug\" ] || [ \" $1 \" = \"run\" ] then ti= \"-ti\" fi docker run -e NEWT_USER= $( id -u ) -e NEWT_GROUP= $( id -g ) -e NEWT_HOST= $( uname ) $ti --rm --device = /dev/bus/usb --privileged -v $(pwd) :/workspace -w /workspace mynewt/newt:latest /newt \" $@ \" Note 1: Remember to point to the correct subdirectory level when invoking newt .

Enable USB2 Support for Mac or Windows If you plan on loading your application on an actual device, do the steps below. Install VirtualBox extension pack Docker uses a VirtualBox Linux VM to run containers. A free VirtualBox extension pack is required to enable USB2 support. Download the VirtualBox 5.0.16 Oracle VM VirtualBox Extension Pack and double click to install Enable USB2 and select your device The \"default\" VM created by docker-machine must first be stopped before you can enable USB2. You have two options: Run the command docker-machine stop default in the terminal window or Use the VirtualBox UI. Right click on default -> Close -> Power Off Enable USB2 using the VirtualBox UI. Select the \"default\" VM->Settings->Ports->USB2 to enable USB2. Add your device to the USB Device Filters to make the device visible in the docker container. See the image below. Restart the \"default\" VM. You have two options: Run docker-machine start default in the terminal window or Use the VirtualBox UI. Make sure the \"default\" machine is highlighted. Click the green \"Start\" button. Select \"Headless Start\". Note 3 : When working with actual hardware, remember that each board has an ID. If you swap boards and do not refresh the USB Device Filter on the VirtualBox UI, the ID might be stale and the Docker instance may not be able to see the board correctly. For example, you may see an error message like Error: unable to find CMSIS-DAP device when you try to load or run an image on the board. In that case, you need to click on the USB link in VirtualBox UI, remove the existing USB Device Filter (e.g. \"Atmel Corp.

For example, if you see a [-Werror=misleading-indentation] error while building the sim image, add -Wno-misleading-indentation] as a compiler flag in the same line from the <mynewt-src-directory>/repos/apache-mynewt-core/compiler/sim/compiler.yml file. compiler.flags.base: > -m32 -Wall -Werror -ggdb -Wno-misleading-indentation A third option is to simply downgrade to gcc 5.x .","title":"Installing gcc/libc"},{"location":"os/get_started/native_tools/#installing-gdb","text":"$ brew install gdb ... ... ==> Summary \ud83c\udf7a /usr/local/Cellar/gdb/7.10.1: XXX files,YYM NOTE: When running a program with gdb, you may need to sign your gdb executable.

We recommend that you read the section on creating a new project and fetching the source repository to understand the Mynewt repository structure, create a new project, and fetch the source dependencies before proceeding to one of the Blinky Tutorials . This guide shows you how to: Create a new project and fetch the source repository and dependecies. Test the project packages (Not supported on Windows).

Fetching the Mynewt Source Repository and Dependencies By default, Mynewt projects rely on a single repository: apache-mynewt-core and uses the source in the master branch. If you need to use a different branch, you need to change the vers value in the project.yml file: repository.apache-mynewt-core: type: github vers: 1-latest user: apache repo: incubator-mynewt-core Changing vers to 0-dev will put you on the latest master branch. This branch may not be stable and you may encounter bugs or other problems. Note: On Windows platforms, you will need to change vers to 0-dev and use the latest master branch. Release 1.0.0 is not supported on Windows. Run the newt install command, from your project base directory (myproj), to fetch the source repository and dependencies: $ newt install apache-mynewt-core Note: It may take a while to download the apache-mynewt-core reposistory.

Exploring other Mynewt OS Features Congratulations, you have created your first project! The blinky application is not terribly exciting when it is run in the simulator, as there is no LED to blink. Apache Mynewt has a lot more functionality than just running simulated applications. It provides all the features you'll need to cross-compile your application, run it on real hardware and develop a full featured application. If you're interested in learning more, a good next step is to dig in to one of the tutorials and get a Mynewt project running on real hardware.

Happy Hacking!","title":"Exploring other Mynewt OS Features"},{"location":"os/get_started/serial_access/","text":"Using the Serial Port with Mynewt OS Some of the projects and tutorials here will allow you to use a serial port to interact with your Mynewt project. While most modern PCs and laptops no longer have a true serial port, almost all can use their USB ports as serial ports. This will show you how to connect to some of the development boards we use via a serial port. The development boards covered here are: Nordic Semiconductor NRF52dk Arduino M0 Pro In order to communicate with these boards you will also need a USB<-->Serial converted. We'll be using the AdaFruit FT232H Breakout Board for this, but almost any similar board should work just as well. You will also need Minicom or a similar Serial communications application. We'll show you how to use the screen command built in to Mac OS X, but later tutorials will also show Minicom setup. So let's get started! Setup FT232H This is a great board because it's so easy to set up, and it can do Serial UART, SPI, I2C and GPIO as well. There's full documentation on the board here but we're only covering the wiring for the Serial UART. Start by connecting a jumper wire to Pin D0. This will be the UART Tx pin, which we'll then connect to the Rx pin on the Development Board. Next connect a jumper wire to pin D1. This will be the UART Rx pin, which we'll connect to the Tx pin on the development board. Finally connect a jumper wire to the GND pin. It should look like this: Setup Nordic Semiconductor NRF52DK On the NRF52DK developer kit board, the Rx pin is P0.08, so you'll attach your jumper wire from the Tx pin (D0) of the FT232H board here. The TX Pin is pin P0.06, so you'll attache the jumper wire from the Rx Pin (D1) on the FT232H board here. Finally, the GND wire should go to the GND Pin on the NRF52DK. When you're done, your wiring should look like this: Setup Arduino M0 Pro On the Arduino M0 Pro, the Tx and Rx pins are clearly labeled as such, as is the GND pin. Just make sure you wire Rx from the FT232H to TX on the M0 Pro, and vice-versa. Your Arduino M0 Pro should look like this: Setup Serial Communications You will need to know the serial port to connect to and use a terminal program to connect to the board. Example for Mac OS and Linux Platforms First check what USB devices are already connected before connecting the FT232H board to your computer. The ports are listed in the /dev directory and the format of the port name is platform dependent: Mac OS uses the format tty.usbserial-<some identifier> . Linux uses the format TTYUSB<N> , where N is a number. For example, TTYUSB2. This example is run on a Mac OS system. Check what USB devices are already connected: $ ls -la /dev/*usb* 0 crw-rw-rw- 1 root wheel 20, 63 Nov 23 11:13 /dev/cu.usbmodem401322 0 crw-rw-rw- 1 root wheel 20, 62 Nov 23 11:13 /dev/tty.usbmodem401322 $ Plug in the FT232H board and check the ports again: $ ls -la /dev/*usb* 0 crw-rw-rw- 1 root wheel 20, 63 Nov 23 11:13 /dev/cu.usbmodem401322 0 crw-rw-rw- 1 root wheel 20, 65 Nov 23 11:26 /dev/cu.usbserial-0020124 0 crw-rw-rw- 1 root wheel 20, 62 Nov 23 11:13 /dev/tty.usbmodem401322 0 crw-rw-rw- 1 root wheel 20, 64 Nov 23 11:26 /dev/tty.usbserial-0020124 $ The FT232H is connected to /dev/tty.usbserial-0020124 (The number after tty.usbserial will be different on your machine.)

Example for Windows Platforms First check what USB devices are already connected before connecting the FT232H board to your computer. You can locate the ports from a MinGW terminal or use the Windows Device Manager. On a MinGW terminal, the ports are listed in the /dev directory and the format of the port name is ttyS<N> where N is a number.

Project The project is the base directory of your embedded software tree. It is a workspace that contains a logical collection of source code, for one or more of your applications. A project consists of the following items: Project Definition: defines project level dependencies, and parameters (located in project.yml ) Packages Packages are described in detail in the section below. Here is an example project definition file from the default Apache Mynewt project: $ more project.yml <snip> project.name: \"my_project\" project.repositories: - apache-mynewt-core # Use github's distribution mechanism for core ASF libraries. # This provides mirroring automatically for us. # repository.apache-mynewt-core: type: github vers: 1-latest user: apache repo: incubator-mynewt-core $ A couple of things to note in the project definition: project.repositories : Defines the remote repositories that this project relies upon. repository.apache-mynewt-core : Defines the repository information for the apache-mynewt-core repository. vers=1-latest : Defines the repository version. This string will use the latest stable version in the 'Master' github branch. To use the latest version in the master branch, just change it to vers=0-dev . Note that this branch might not be stable. Repositories are versioned collections of packages. Projects can rely on remote repositories for functionality, and the newt tool will resolve those remote repositories, and download the correct version into your local source tree. Newly fetched repositories are put in the repos directory of your project, and can be referenced throughout the system by using the @ specifier. By default, the @apache-mynewt-core repository is included in every project. Apache Mynewt Core contains all the base functionality of the Apache Mynewt Operating System, including the Real Time Kernel, Bluetooth Networking Stack, Flash File System, Console, Shell and Bootloader. NOTE: Any project can be converted into a repository by providing it with a repository.yml file and putting it up onto Github.

It manages images for the embedded system and upgrades of those images using protocols over various interfaces (e.g. serial, BLE, etc.). Typically, systems with bootloaders have at least two program images coexisting on the same microcontroller, and hence must include branch code that performs a check to see if an attempt to update software is already underway and manage the progress of the process. The bootloader in the Apache Mynewt project verifies the cryptographic signature of the firmware image before running it. It maintains a detailed status log for each stage of the boot process. For verification of the authenticity of the OS image, it: Calculates hash of the image. Uses public key to uncover hash value from included signature. Compares the calculated and uncovered hashes for a match. The \"secure bootloader\" should be placed in protected memory on a given microcontroller. The Mynewt bootloader comprises two packages: The bootutil library (boot/bootutil) The boot application (apps/boot) The Mynewt code is thus structured so that the generic bootutil library performs most of the functions of a boot loader. The final step of actually jumping to the main image is kept out of the bootutil library. This last step should instead be implemented in an architecture-specific project. Boot loader functionality is separated in this manner for the following two reasons: By keeping architecture-dependent code separate, the bootutil library can be reused among several boot loaders. By excluding the last boot step from the library, the bootloader can be unit tested since a library can be unit tested but an applicant can't. Limitations The boot loader currently only supports images with the following characteristics: Built to run from flash. Build to run from a fixed location (i.e., position-independent). Image Format The following definitions describe the image header format. #define IMAGE_MAGIC 0x96f3b83c #define IMAGE_MAGIC_NONE 0xffffffff struct image_version { uint8_t iv_major ; uint8_t iv_minor ; uint16_t iv_revision ; uint32_t iv_build_num ; }; /** Image header. All fields are in little endian byte order. */ struct image_header { uint32_t ih_magic ; uint16_t ih_tlv_size ; /* Trailing TLVs */ uint8_t ih_key_id ; uint8_t _pad1 ; uint16_t ih_hdr_size ; uint16_t _pad2 ; uint32_t ih_img_size ; /* Does not include header. */ uint32_t ih_flags ; struct image_version ih_ver ; uint32_t _pad3 ; }; The ih_hdr_size field indicates the length of the header, and therefore the offset of the image itself. This field provides for backwards compatibility in case of changes to the format of the image header. The following are the image header flags available. #define IMAGE_F_PIC 0x00000001 #define IMAGE_F_SHA256 0x00000002 /* Image contains hash TLV */ #define IMAGE_F_PKCS15_RSA2048_SHA256 0x00000004 /* PKCS15 w/RSA and SHA */ #define IMAGE_F_ECDSA224_SHA256 0x00000008 /* ECDSA256 over SHA256 */ #define IMAGE_F_NON_BOOTABLE 0x00000010 #define IMAGE_HEADER_SIZE 32 Optional type-length-value records (TLVs) containing image metadata are placed after the end of the image. For example, security data gets added as a footer at the end of the image. /** Image trailer TLV format. All fields in little endian. */ struct image_tlv { uint8_t it_type ; /* IMAGE_TLV_[...]. */ uint8_t _pad ; uint16_t it_len /* Data length (not including TLV header). */ }; /* * Image trailer TLV types. */ #define IMAGE_TLV_SHA256 1 /* SHA256 of image hdr and body */ #define IMAGE_TLV_RSA2048 2 /* RSA2048 of hash output */ #define IMAGE_TLV_ECDSA224 3 /* ECDSA of hash output */ Flash Map A Mynewt device's flash is partitioned according to its flash map . At a high level, the flash map maps numeric IDs to flash areas . A flash area is a region of disk with the following properties: An area can be fully erased without affecting any other areas. A write to one area does not restrict writes to other areas. The boot loader uses the following flash areas: #define FLASH_AREA_BOOTLOADER 0 #define FLASH_AREA_IMAGE_0 1 #define FLASH_AREA_IMAGE_1 2 #define FLASH_AREA_IMAGE_SCRATCH 3 Image Slots A portion of the flash memory is partitioned into two image slots: a primary slot and a secondary slot. The boot loader will only run an image from the primary slot, so images must be built such that they can run from that fixed location in flash. If the boot loader needs to run the image resident in the secondary slot, it must swap the two images in flash prior to booting. In addition to the two image slots, the boot loader requires a scratch area to allow for reliable image swapping. Boot States Logically, you can think of a pair of flags associated with each image slot: pending and confirmed. On startup, the boot loader determines the state of the device by inspecting each pair of flags. These flags have the following meanings: pending: image gets tested on next reboot; absent subsequent confirm command, revert to original image on second reboot. confirmed: always use image unless excluded by a test image. In English, when the user wants to run the secondary image, they set the pending flag for the second slot and reboot the device. On startup, the boot loader will swap the two images in flash, clear the secondary slot's pending flag, and run the newly-copied image in slot 0. This is a temporary state; if the device reboots again, the boot loader swaps the images back to their original slots and boots into the original image. If the user doesn't want to revert to the original state, they can make the current state permanent by setting the confirmed flag in slot 0. Switching to an alternate image is a two-step process (set + confirm) to prevent a device from becoming \"bricked\" by bad firmware. If the device crashes immediately upon booting the second image, the boot loader reverts to the working image, rather than repeatedly rebooting into the bad image. The following set of tables illustrate the three possible states that the device can be in: | slot-0 | slot-1 | ---------------+--------+--------| pending | | | confirmed | X | | ---------------+--------+--------' Image 0 confirmed; | No change on reboot | ---------------------------------' | slot-0 | slot-1 | ---------------+--------+--------| pending | | X | confirmed | X | | ---------------+--------+--------' Image 0 confirmed; | Test image 1 on next reboot | ---------------------------------' | slot-0 | slot-1 | ---------------+--------+--------| pending | | | confirmed | | X | ---------------+--------+--------' Testing image 0; | Revert to image 1 on next reboot | ---------------------------------' Boot Vector At startup, the boot loader determines which of the above three boot states a device is in by inspecting the boot vector. The boot vector consists of two records (called \"image trailers\"), one written at the end of each image slot. An image trailer has the following structure: 0 1 2 3 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ ~ MAGIC (16 octets) ~ +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ ~ ~ ~ Swap status (128 * min-write-size * 3) ~ ~ ~ +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ | Copy done | 0xff padding (up to min-write-sz - 1) ~ +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ | Image OK | 0xff padding (up to min-write-sz - 1) ~ +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ These records are at the end of each image slot. The offset immediately following such a record represents the start of the next flash area. Note: min-write-size is a property of the flash hardware. If the hardware allows individual bytes to be written at arbitrary addresses, then min-write-size is 1. If the hardware only allows writes at even addresses, then min-write-size is 2, and so on. The fields are defined as follows: MAGIC: The following 16 bytes, written in host-byte-order: const uint32_t boot_img_magic[4] = { 0xf395c277, 0x7fefd260, 0x0f505235, 0x8079b62c, }; Swap status: A series of single-byte records. Each record corresponds to a flash sector in an image slot. A swap status byte indicate the location of the corresponding sector data. During an image swap, image data is moved one sector at a time. The swap status is necessary for resuming a swap operation if the device rebooted before a swap operation completed. Copy done: A single byte indicating whether the image in this slot is complete ( 0x01=done, 0xff=not done ). Image OK: A single byte indicating whether the image in this slot has been confirmed as good by the user ( 0x01=confirmed; 0xff=not confirmed ). The boot vector records are structured around the limitations imposed by flash hardware. As a consequence, they do not have a very intuitive design, and it is difficult to get a sense of the state of the device just by looking at the boot vector. It is better to map all the possible vector states to the swap types (None, Test, Revert) via a set of tables. These tables are reproduced below. In these tables, the \"pending\" and \"confirmed\" flags are shown for illustrative purposes; they are not actually present in the boot vector. State I | slot-0 | slot-1 | -----------------+--------+--------| magic | Unset | Unset | image-ok | Any | N/A | -----------------+--------+--------' pending | | | confirmed | X | | -----------------+--------+--------' swap: none | -----------------------------------' State II | slot-0 | slot-1 | -----------------+--------+--------| magic | Any | Good | image-ok | Any | N/A | -----------------+--------+--------' pending | | X | confirmed | X | | -----------------+--------+--------' swap: test | -----------------------------------' State III | slot-0 | slot-1 | -----------------+--------+--------| magic | Good | Unset | image-ok | 0xff | N/A | -----------------+--------+--------' pending | | | confirmed | | X | -----------------+--------+--------' swap: revert (test image running) | -----------------------------------' State IV | slot-0 | slot-1 | -----------------+--------+--------| magic | Good | Unset | image-ok | 0x01 | N/A | -----------------+--------+--------' pending | | | confirmed | X | | -----------------+--------+--------' swap: none (confirmed test image) | -----------------------------------' High-level Operation With the terms defined, we can now explore the boot loader's operation. First, a high-level overview of the boot process is presented. Then, the following sections describe each step of the process in more detail. Procedure: A. Inspect swap status region; is an interrupted swap is being resumed? Yes: Complete the partial swap operation; skip to step C. No: Proceed to step B. B. Inspect boot vector; is a swap requested? Yes. 1. Is the requested image valid (integrity and security check)? Yes. a. Perform swap operation. b. Persist completion of swap procedure to boot vector. c. Proceed to step C. No. a. Erase invalid image. b. Persist failure of swap procedure to boot vector. c. Proceed to step C. No: Proceed to step C. C. Boot into image in slot 0. Image Swapping The boot loader swaps the contents of the two image slots for two reasons: User has issued an \"image test\" operation; the image in slot-1 should be run once (state II). Test image rebooted without being confirmed; the boot loader should revert to the original image currently in slot-1 (state III). If the boot vector indicates that the image in the secondary slot should be run, the boot loader needs to copy it to the primary slot. The image currently in the primary slot also needs to be retained in flash so that it can be used later. Furthermore, both images need to be recoverable if the boot loader resets in the middle of the swap operation. The two images are swapped according to the following procedure: 1. Determine how many flash sectors each image slot consists of. This number must be the same for both slots. 2. Iterate the list of sector indices in descending order (i.e., starting with the greatest index); current element = \"index\". b. Erase scratch area. c. Copy slot0[index] to scratch area. d. Write updated swap status (i). e. Erase slot1[index] f. Copy slot0[index] to slot1[index] - If these are the last sectors (i.e., first swap being perfomed), copy the full sector *except* the image trailer. - Else, copy entire sector contents. g. Write updated swap status (ii). h. Erase slot0[index]. i. Copy scratch area slot0[index]. j. Write updated swap status (iii). 3. Persist completion of swap procedure to slot 0 image trailer. The additional caveats in step 2f are necessary so that the slot 1 image trailer can be written by the user at a later time. With the image trailer unwritten, the user can test the image in slot 1 (i.e., transition to state II). The particulars of step 3 vary depending on whether an image is being tested or reverted: * test: o Write slot0.copy_done = 1 (should now be in state III) * revert: o Write slot0.magic = BOOT_MAGIC o Write slot0.copy_done = 1 o Write slot0.image_ok = 1 (should now be in state IV) Swap Status The swap status region allows the boot loader to recover in case it restarts in the middle of an image swap operation. The swap status region consists of a series of single-byte records. These records are written independently, and therefore must be padded according to the minimum write size imposed by the flash hardware. In the below figure, a min-write-size of 1 is assumed for simplicity. The structure of the swap status region is illustrated below. In this figure, a min-write-size of 1 is assumed for simplicity. 0 1 2 3 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ |sec127,state 0 |sec127,state 1 |sec127,state 2 |sec126,state 0 | +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ |sec126,state 1 |sec126,state 2 |sec125,state 0 |sec125,state 1 | +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ |sec125,state 2 | | +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ + ~ ~ ~ [Records for indices 124 through 1 ~ ~ ~ ~ +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ ~ |sec000,state 0 |sec000,state 1 |sec000,state 2 | +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ And now, in English... Each image slot is partitioned into a sequence of flash sectors. If we were to enumerate the sectors in a single slot, starting at 0, we would have a list of sector indices. Since there are two image slots, each sector index would correspond to a pair of sectors. For example, sector index 0 corresponds to the first sector in slot 0 and the first sector in slot 1. Furthermore, we impose a limit of 128 indices. If an image slot consists of more than 128 sectors, the flash layout is not compatible with this boot loader. Finally, reverse the list of indices such that the list starts with index 127 and ends with 0. The swap status region is a representation of this reversed list. During a swap operation, each sector index transitions through four separate states: 0. slot 0: image 0, slot 1: image 1, scratch: N/A 1. slot 0: image 0, slot 1: N/A, scratch: image 1 (1->s, erase 1) 2. slot 0: N/A, slot 1: image 0, scratch: image 1 (0->1, erase 0) 3. slot 0: image 1, slot 1: image 0, scratch: N/A (s->0) Each time a sector index transitions to a new state, the boot loader writes a record to the swap status region. Logically, the boot loader only needs one record per sector index to keep track of the current swap state. However, due to limitations imposed by flash hardware, a record cannot be overwritten when an index's state changes. To solve this problem, the boot loader uses three records per sector index rather than just one. Each sector-state pair is represented as a set of three records. The record values map to the above four states as follows | rec0 | rec1 | rec2 --------+------+------+------ state 0 | 0xff | 0xff | 0xff state 1 | 0x01 | 0xff | 0xff state 2 | 0x01 | 0x02 | 0xff state 3 | 0x01 | 0x02 | 0x03 The swap status region can accommodate 128 sector indices. Hence, the size of the region, in bytes, is 128 * min-write-size * 3 . The number 128 is chosen somewhat arbitrarily and will likely be made configurable. The only requirement for the index count is that is is great enough to account for a maximum-sized image (i.e., at least as great as the total sector count in an image slot). If a device's image slots use less than 128 sectors, the first record that gets written will be somewhere in the middle of the region. For example, if a slot uses 64 sectors, the first sector index that gets swapped is 63, which corresponds to the exact halfway point within the region. Reset Recovery If the boot loader resets in the middle of a swap operation, the two images may be discontiguous in flash. Bootutil recovers from this condition by using the boot vector to determine how the image parts are distributed in flash. The first step is determine where the relevant swap status region is located. Because this region is embedded within the image slots, its location in flash changes during a swap operation. The below set of tables map boot vector contents to swap status location. In these tables, the \"source\" field indicates where the swap status region is located. | slot-0 | scratch | ----------+------------+------------| magic | Good | Any | copy-done | 0x01 | N/A | ----------+------------+------------' source: none | ------------------------------------' | slot-0 | scratch | ----------+------------+------------| magic | Good | Any | copy-done | 0xff | N/A | ----------+------------+------------' source: slot 0 | ------------------------------------' | slot-0 | scratch | ----------+------------+------------| magic | Any | Good | copy-done | Any | N/A | ----------+------------+------------' source: scratch | ------------------------------------' | slot-0 | scratch | ----------+------------+------------| magic | Unset | Any | copy-done | 0xff | N/A | ----------+------------+------------| source: varies | ------------------------------------+------------------------------+ This represents one of two cases: | o No swaps ever (no status to read, so no harm in checking). | o Mid-revert; status in slot 0. | -------------------------------------------------------------------' If the swap status region indicates that the images are not contiguous, bootutil completes the swap operation that was in progress when the system was reset. In other words, it applies the procedure defined in the previous section, moving image 1 into slot 0 and image 0 into slot 1. If the boot status file indicates that an image part is present in the scratch area, this part is copied into the correct location by starting at step e or step h in the area-swap procedure, depending on whether the part belongs to image 0 or image 1. After the swap operation has been completed, the boot loader proceeds as though it had just been started. Integrity Check An image is checked for integrity immediately before it gets copied into the primary slot. If the boot loader doesn't perform an image swap, then it doesn't perform an integrity check. During the integrity check, the boot loader verifies the following aspects of an image: 32-bit magic number must be correct (0x96f3b83c). Image must contain a SHA256 TLV. Calculated SHA256 must matche SHA256 TLV contents. Image may contain a signature TLV. If it does, its contents must be verifiable using a key embedded in the boot loader. Image Signing and Verification As indicated above, the final step of the integrity check is signature verification. The boot loader can have one or more public keys embedded in it at build time. During signature verification, the boot loader verifies that an image was signed with a private key that corresponds to one of its public keys. The image signature TLV indicates the index of the key that is has been signed with. The boot loader uses this index to identify the corresponding public key.

In English, when the user wants to run the secondary image, they set the pending flag for the second slot and reboot the device. On startup, the boot loader will swap the two images in flash, clear the secondary slot's pending flag, and run the newly-copied image in slot 0.

Switching to an alternate image is a two-step process (set + confirm) to prevent a device from becoming \"bricked\" by bad firmware.

It initializes and enables components within a master processor. It is designed to be portable across all the various MCUs supported in Mynewt (e.g. Nordic's nRF51, Nordic's nRF52, NXP's MK64F12 etc.). It includes code that initializes and manages access to components of the board such as board buses (I2C, PCI, PCMCIA, etc.), off-chip memory (controllers, level 2+ cache, Flash, etc.), and off-chip I/O (Ethernet, RS-232, display, mouse, etc.) The driver sits atop the BSP and HAL. It abstracts the common modes of operation for each peripheral device connected via the standard interfaces to the processor. There may be multiple driver implementations of differing complexities for a particular peripheral device. For example, for an Analog to Digital Converter (ADC) peripheral you might have a simple driver that does blocking ADC reads and uses the HAL only. You might have a more complex driver that can deal with both internal and external ADCs, and has chip specific support for doing things like DMA\u2019ing ADC reads into a buffer and posting an event to a task every \u2019n\u2019 samples. The drivers are the ones that register with the kernel\u2019s power management APIs, and manage turning on and off peripherals and external chipsets, etc. The Mynewt core repository comes with a base set of drivers to help the user get started. General design principles Device drivers should have a consistent structure and unified interface whenever possible. For example, we have a top-level package, \u201cadc\u201d, which contains the interface for all ADC drivers, and then we have the individual implementation of the driver itself. The following source files point to this: high-level ADC API: hw/drivers/adc/include/adc/adc.h implementation of ADC for STM32F4: hw/drivers/adc/adc_stm32f4/src/adc_stm32f4.c (As of the 1.0.0-beta release, ADC for nRF51 and nRF52 are available at an external repo . They are expected to be pulled into the core repo on Apache Mynewt after the license terms are clarified.). The only exported call in this example is int stm32f4_adc_dev_init(struct os_dev *, void *) which is passed as a function pointer to os_dev_create() in hal_bsp.c , when the adc device is created. Device drivers should be easy to use. In Mynewt, creating a device initializes it as well, making it readily available for the user to open, use (e.g. read, configure etc.) and close. Creating a device is simple using os_dev_create(struct os_dev *dev, char *name, uint8_t stage, uint8_t priority, os_dev_init_func_t od_init, void *arg) . The od_init function is defined within the appropriate driver directory e.g. stm32f4_adc_dev_init in hw/drivers/adc/adc_stm32f4/src/adc_stm32f4.c for the ADC device initialization function. The implementation should allow for builds optimized for minimal memory usage. Additional functionality can be enabled by writing a more complex driver (usually based on the simple implementation included by default in the core repository) and optionally compiling the relevant packages in. Typically, only a basic driver that addresses a device\u2019s core functionality (covering ~90% of use cases) is included in the Mynewt core repository, thus keeping the footprint small. The implementation should allow a user to be able to instantiate multiple devices of a certain kind. In the Mynewt environment the user can, for example, maintain separate contexts for multiple ADCs over different peripheral connections such as SPI, I2C etc. It is also possible for a user to use a single peripheral interface (e.g. SPI) to drive multiple devices (e.g. ADC), and in that case the device driver has to handle the proper synchronization of the various tasks. Device drivers should be MCU independent. In Mynewt, device creation and operation functions are independent of the underlying MCU. Device drivers should be able to offer high-level interfaces for generic operations common to a particular device group. An example of such a class or group of devices is a group for sensors with generic operations such as channel discovery, configure, and read values. The organization of the driver directory is work in progress - so we encourage you to hop on the dev@ mailing list and offer your insights! Device drivers should be searchable. The plan is to have the newt tool offer a newt pkg search capability. This is work in progress. You are welcome to join the conversation on the dev@ mailing list!

You append entries to the end, and read data from the beginning. Description Elements in the flash contain the length of the element, the data within the element, and checksum over the element contents. Storage of elements in flash is done in a FIFO fashion. When user requests space for the next element, space is located at the end of the used area. When user starts reading, the first element served is the oldest element in flash. Elements can be appended to the end of the area until storage space is exhausted. User has control over what happens next; either erase oldest block of data, thereby freeing up some space, or stop writing new data until existing data has been collected. FCB treats underlying storage as an array of flash sectors; when it erases old data, it does this a sector at a time. Elements in the flash are checksummed. That is how FCB detects whether writing element to flash completed ok. It will skip over entries which don't have a valid checksum. Usage To add an element to circular buffer: Call fcb_append() to get the location where data can be written. If this fails due to lack of space, you can call fcb_rotate() to make some. And then call fcb_append() again. Use flash_area_write() to write element contents. Call fcb_append_finish() when done. This completes the entry by calculating the checksum. To read contents of the circular buffer: * Call fcb_walk() with a pointer to your callback function. * Within callback function copy in data from the element using flash_area_read(). You can tell when all data from within a sector has been read by monitoring returned element's area pointer. Then you can call fcb_rotate(), if you're done with that data. Alternatively: * Call fcb_getnext() with 0 in element offset to get the pointer to oldest element. * Use flash_area_read() to read element contents. * Call fcb_getnext() with pointer to current element to get the next one. And so on. Data structures This data structure describes the element location in the flash. You would use it figure out what parameters to pass to flash_area_read() to read element contents. Or to flash_area_write() when adding a new element. struct fcb_entry { struct flash_area *fe_area ; uint32_t fe_elem_off ; uint32_t fe_data_off ; uint16_t fe_data_len ; }; Element Description fe_area Pointer to info about the flash sector. Pass this to flash_area_xx() routines. fe_elem_off Byte offset from the start of the sector to beginning of element. fe_data_off Byte offset from start of the sector to beginning of element data. Pass this to to flash_area_xx() routines. fe_data_len Number of bytes in the element. The following data structure describes the FCB itself. First part should be filled in by the user before calling fcb_init(). The second part is used by FCB for its internal bookkeeping. struct fcb { /* Caller of fcb_init fills this in */ uint32_t f_magic ; /* As placed on the disk */ uint8_t f_version ; /* Current version number of the data */ uint8_t f_sector_cnt ; /* Number of elements in sector array */ uint8_t f_scratch_cnt ; /* How many sectors should be kept empty */ struct flash_area *f_sectors ; /* Array of sectors, must be contiguous */ /* Flash circular buffer internal state */ struct os_mutex f_mtx ; /* Locking for accessing the FCB data */ struct flash_area *f_oldest ; struct fcb_entry f_active ; uint16_t f_active_id ; uint8_t f_align ; /* writes to flash have to aligned to this */ }; Element Description f_magic Magic number in the beginning of FCB flash sector. FCB uses this when determining whether sector contains valid data or not. f_version Current version number of the data. Also stored in flash sector header. f_sector_cnt Number of elements in the f_sectors array. f_scratch_cnt Number of sectors to keep empty. This can be used if you need to have scratch space for garbage collecting when FCB fills up. f_sectors Array of entries describing flash sectors to use. f_mtx Lock protecting access to FCBs internal data. f_oldest Pointer to flash sector containing the oldest data. This is where data is served when read is started. f_active Flash location where the newest data is. This is used by fcb_append() to figure out where the data should go to. f_active_id Flash sectors are assigned ever-increasing serial numbers. This is how FCB figures out where oldest data is on system restart. f_align Some flashes have restrictions on alignment for writes. FCB keeps a copy of this number for the flash here. List of Functions The functions available in this OS feature are: Function Description fcb_init Initializes the FCB. After calling this, you can start reading/writing data from FCB. fcb_append Start writing a new element to flash. fcb_append_finish Finalizes the write of new element. FCB computes the checksum over the element and updates it in flash. fcb_walk Walks over all log entries in FCB. fcb_getnext Fills given FCB location with information about next element. fcb_rotate Erase the oldest sector in FCB. fcb_append_to_scratch If FCB uses scratch blocks, use reserve blocks when FCB is filled. fcb_is_empty Returns 1 if there are no elements stored in FCB, otherwise returns 0. fcb_offset_last_n Returns the offset of n-th last element. fcb_clear Wipes out all data in FCB.","title":"toc"},{"location":"os/modules/fcb/fcb/#flash-circular-buffer-fcb","text":"Flash circular buffer provides an abstration through which you can treat flash like a FIFO.

Description Applications should aim to minimize the amount of code which depends on a particular file system implementation. When possible, only depend on the fs/fs package. In terms of the Mynewt hierarchy, an app package must depend on a specific file system package, while library packages should only depend on fs/fs .

Description Areas At the top level, an nffs disk is partitioned into areas . An area is a region of disk with the following properties: An area can be fully erased without affecting any other areas. Writing to one area does not restrict writes to other areas. Regarding property 1: Generally, flash hardware divides its memory space into \"blocks.\" When erasing flash, entire blocks must be erased in a single operation; partial erases are not possible. Regarding property 2: Furthermore, some flash hardware imposes a restriction with regards to writes: writes within a block must be strictly sequential. For example, if you wish to write to the first 16 bytes of a block, you must write bytes 1 through 15 before writing byte 16. This restriction only applies at the block level; writes to one block have no effect on what parts of other blocks can be written. Thus, each area must comprise a discrete number of blocks. Initialization As part of overall system initialization, mynewt re-initialized the filesystem as follows: Restores an existing file system via detection. Creates a new file system via formatting. A typical initialization sequence is the following: Detect an nffs file system in a specific region of flash. If no file system was detected, if configured to do so, format a new file system in the same flash region. Note that in the latter case, the behavior is controlled with a variable in the syscfg.yml file. If NFFS_DETECT_FAIL is set to 1, the system ignores NFFS filesystem detection issues, but unless a new filesystem is formatted manually, all filesystem access will fail. If NFFS_DETECT_FAIL is set to 2, the system will format a new filesystem - note however this effectively deletes all existing data in the NFFS flash areas. Both methods require the user to describe how the flash memory should be divided into nffs areas. This is accomplished with an array of struct nffs_area_desc configured as part of the BSP configureation. After nffs has been initialized, the application can access the file system via the file system abstraction layer .

Together, the set of blocks in a file form a reverse singly-linked list. The maximum number of data bytes that a block can contain is determined at initialization-time. The result is the greatest number which satisfies all of the following restrictions: No more than 2048. At least two maximum-sized blocks can fit in the smallest area. The 2048 number was chosen somewhat arbitrarily, and may change in the future. ID space All disk objects have a unique 32-bit ID. The ID space is partitioned as follows: ID range Node type 0x00000000 - 0x0fffffff Directory inodes 0x10000000 - 0x7fffffff File inodes 0x80000000 - 0xfffffffe Data blocks 0xffffffff Reserved (NFFS_ID_NONE) Scratch area A valid nffs file system must contain a single \"scratch area.\" The scratch area does not contain any objects of its own, and is only used during garbage collection. The scratch area must have a size greater than or equal to each of the other areas in flash. RAM representation Every object in the file system is stored in a 256-entry hash table. An object's hash key is derived from its 32-bit ID. Each list in the hash table is sorted by time of use; most-recently-used is at the front of the list. All objects are represented by the following structure: /** * What gets stored in the hash table. Each entry represents a data block or * an inode. */ struct nffs_hash_entry { SLIST_ENTRY ( nffs_hash_entry ) nhe_next ; uint32_t nhe_id ; /* 0 - 0x7fffffff if inode; else if block. */ uint32_t nhe_flash_loc ; /* Upper-byte = area idx; rest = area offset. */ }; For each data block, the above structure is all that is stored in RAM. To acquire more information about a data block, the block header must be read from flash. Inodes require a fuller RAM representation to capture the structure of the file system. There are two types of inodes: files and directories . Each inode hash entry is actually an instance of the following structure: /** Each inode hash entry is actually one of these. */ struct nffs_inode_entry { struct nffs_hash_entry nie_hash_entry ; SLIST_ENTRY ( nffs_inode_entry ) nie_sibling_next ; union { struct nffs_inode_list nie_child_list ; /* If directory */ struct nffs_hash_entry *nie_last_block_entry ; /* If file */ }; uint8_t nie_refcnt ; }; A directory inode contains a list of its child files and directories ( fie_child_list ). These entries are sorted alphabetically using the ASCII character set. A file inode contains a pointer to the last data block in the file ( nie_last_block_entry ). For most file operations, the reversed block list must be walked backwards. This introduces a number of speed inefficiencies: All data blocks must be read to determine the length of the file. Data blocks often need to be processed sequentially. The reversed nature of the block list transforms this from linear time to an O(n^2) operation. Furthermore, obtaining information about any constituent data block requires a separate flash read. Inode cache and Data Block cache The speed issues are addressed by a pair of caches. Cached inodes entries contain the file length and a much more convenient doubly-linked list of cached data blocks. The benefit of using caches is that the size of the caches need not be proportional to the size of the file system. In other words, caches can address speed efficiency concerns without negatively impacting the file system's scalability. nffs requires both caches during normal operation, so it is not possible to disable them. However, the cache sizes are configurable, and both caches can be configured with a size of one if RAM usage must be minimized. The following data structures are used in the inode and data block caches. /** Full data block representation; not stored permanently in RAM. */ struct nffs_block { struct nffs_hash_entry *nb_hash_entry ; /* Points to real block entry. */ uint32_t nb_seq ; /* Sequence number; greater supersedes lesser. */ struct nffs_inode_entry *nb_inode_entry ; /* Owning inode. */ struct nffs_hash_entry *nb_prev ; /* Previous block in file. */ uint16_t nb_data_len ; /* # of data bytes in block. */ uint16_t reserved16 ; }; /** Represents a single cached data block. */ struct nffs_cache_block { TAILQ_ENTRY ( nffs_cache_block ) ncb_link ; /* Next / prev cached block. */ struct nffs_block ncb_block ; /* Full data block. */ uint32_t ncb_file_offset ; /* File offset of this block. */ }; /** Full inode representation; not stored permanently in RAM. */ struct nffs_inode { struct nffs_inode_entry *ni_inode_entry ; /* Points to real inode entry. */ uint32_t ni_seq ; /* Sequence number; greater supersedes lesser. */ struct nffs_inode_entry *ni_parent ; /* Points to parent directory. */ uint8_t ni_filename_len ; /* # chars in filename. */ uint8_t ni_filename [ NFFS_SHORT_FILENAME_LEN ]; /* First 3 bytes. */ }; /** Doubly-linked tail queue of cached blocks; contained in cached inodes. */ TAILQ_HEAD ( nffs_block_cache_list , nffs_block_cache_entry ); /** Represents a single cached file inode. */ struct nffs_cache_inode { TAILQ_ENTRY ( nffs_cache_inode ) nci_link ; /* Sorted; LRU at tail. */ struct nffs_inode nci_inode ; /* Full inode. */ struct nffs_cache_block_list nci_block_list ; /* List of cached blocks. */ uint32_t nci_file_size ; /* Total file size. */ }; Only file inodes are cached; directory inodes are never cached. Within a cached inode, all cached data blocks are contiguous. E.g., if the start and end of a file are cached, then the middle must also be cached. A data block is only cached if its owning file is also cached. Internally, cached inodes are stored in a singly-linked list, ordered by time of use. The most-recently-used entry is the first element in the list. If a new inode needs to be cached, but the inode cache is full, the least-recently-used entry is freed to make room for the new one. The following operations cause an inode to be cached: Querying a file's length. Seeking within a file. Reading from a file. Writing to a file. The following operations cause a data block to be cached: Reading from the block. Writing to the block. If one of the above operations is applied to a data block that is not currently cached, nffs uses the following procedure to cache the necessary block: If none of the owning inode's blocks are currently cached, allocate a cached block entry corresponding to the requested block and insert it into the inode's list. Else if the requested file offset is less than that of the first cached block, bridge the gap between the inode's sequence of cached blocks and the block that now needs to be cached. This is accomplished by caching each block in the gap, finishing with the requested block. Else (the requested offset is beyond the end of the cache), If the requested offset belongs to the block that immediately follows the end of the cache, cache the block and append it to the list. Else, clear the cache, and populate it with the single entry corresponding to the requested block. If the system is unable to allocate a cached block entry at any point during the above procedure, the system frees up other blocks currently in the cache. This is accomplished as follows: Iterate the inode cache in reverse (i.e., start with the least-recently-used entry). For each entry: If the entry's cached block list is empty, advance to the next entry. Else, free all the cached blocks in the entry's list. Because the system imposes a minimum block cache size of one, the above procedure will always reclaim at least one cache block entry. The above procedure may result in the freeing of the block list that belongs to the very inode being operated on. This is OK, as the final block to get cached is always the block being requested. Detection The file system detection process consists of scanning a specified set of flash regions for valid nffs areas, and then populating the RAM representation of the file system with the detected objects. Detection is initiated with the nffs_detect() function. Not every area descriptor passed to nffs_detect() needs to reference a valid nffs area. Detection is successful as long as a complete file system is detected somewhere in the specified regions of flash. If an application is unsure where a file system might be located, it can initiate detection across the entire flash region. A detected file system is valid if: At least one non-scratch area is present. At least one scratch area is present (only the first gets used if there is more than one). The root directory inode is present. During detection, each indicated region of flash is checked for a valid area header. The contents of each valid non-scratch area are then restored into the nffs RAM representation. The following procedure is applied to each object in the area: Verify the object's integrity via a crc16 check. If invalid, the object is discarded and the procedure restarts on the next object in the area. Convert the disk object into its corresponding RAM representation and insert it into the hash table. If the object is an inode, its reference count is initialized to 1, indicating ownership by its parent directory. If an object with the same ID is already present, then one supersedes the other. Accept the object with the greater sequence number and discard the other. If the object references a nonexistent inode (parent directory in the case of an inode; owning file in the case of a data block), insert a temporary \"dummy\" inode into the hash table so that inter-object links can be maintained until the absent inode is eventually restored. Dummy inodes are identified by a reference count of 0. If a delete record for an inode is encountered, the inode's parent pointer is set to null to indicate that it should be removed from RAM. If nffs encounters an object that cannot be identified (i.e., its magic number is not valid), it scans the remainder of the flash area for the next valid magic number. Upon encountering a valid object, nffs resumes the procedure described above. After all areas have been restored, a sweep is performed across the entire RAM representation so that invalid inodes can be deleted from memory. For each directory inode: If its reference count is 0 (i.e., it is a dummy), migrate its children to the /lost+found directory, and delete it from the RAM representation. This should only happen in the case of file system corruption. If its parent reference is null (i.e., it was deleted), delete it and all its children from the RAM representation. For each file inode: If its reference count is 0 (i.e., it is a dummy), delete it from the RAM representation. This should only happen in the case of file system corruption. (We should try to migrate the file to the lost+found directory in this case, as mentioned in the todo section). When an object is deleted during this sweep, it is only deleted from the RAM representation; nothing is written to disk. When objects are migrated to the lost+found directory, their parent inode reference is permanently updated on the disk. In addition, a single scratch area is identified during the detection process. The first area whose fda_id value is set to 0xff is designated as the file system scratch area. If no valid scratch area is found, the cause could be that the system was restarted while a garbage collection cycle was in progress. Such a condition is identified by the presence of two areas with the same ID. In such a case, the shorter of the two areas is erased and designated as the scratch area. Formatting A new nffs file system is created via formatting. Formatting is achieved via the nffs_format() function. During a successful format, an area header is written to each of the specified locations. One of the areas in the set is designated as the initial scratch area. Flash writes The nffs implementation always writes in a strictly sequential fashion within an area. For each area, the system keeps track of the current offset. Whenever an object gets written to an area, it gets written to that area's current offset, and the offset is increased by the object's disk size. When a write needs to be performed, the nffs implementation selects the appropriate destination area by iterating though each area until one with sufficient free space is encountered. There is no write buffering. Each call to a write function results in a write operation being sent to the flash hardware. New objects Whenever a new object is written to disk, it is assigned the following properties: ID: A unique value is selected from the 32-bit ID space, as appropriate for the object's type. Sequence number: 0 When a new file or directory is created, a corresponding inode is written to flash. Likewise, a new data block also results in the writing of a corresponding disk object. Moving/Renaming files and directories When a file or directory is moved or renamed, its corresponding inode is rewritten to flash with the following properties: ID: Unchanged Sequence number: Previous value plus one. Parent inode: As specified by the move / rename operation. Filename: As specified by the move / rename operation. Because the inode's ID is unchanged, all dependent objects remain valid. Unlinking files and directories When a file or directory is unlinked from its parent directory, a deletion record for the unlinked inode gets written to flash. The deletion record is an inode with the following properties: ID: Unchanged Sequence number: Previous value plus one. Parent inode ID: NFFS_ID_NONE When an inode is unlinked, no deletion records need to be written for the inode's dependent objects (constituent data blocks or child inodes). During the next file system detection, it is recognized that the objects belong to a deleted inode, so they are not restored into the RAM representation. If a file has an open handle at the time it gets unlinked, application code can continued to use the file handle to read and write data. All files retain a reference count, and a file isn't deleted from the RAM representation until its reference code drops to 0. Any attempt to open an unlinked file fails, even if the file is referenced by other file handles. Writing to a file The following procedure is used whenever the application code writes to a file. First, if the write operation specifies too much data to fit into a single block, the operation is split into several separate write operations. Then, for each write operation: Determine which existing blocks the write operation overlaps (n = number of overwritten blocks). If n = 0 , this is an append operation. Write a data block with the following properties: ID: New unique value. Sequence number: 0. Else (n > 1) , this write overlaps existing data. For each block in [1, 2, ... n-1] , write a new block containing the updated contents. Each new block supersedes the block it overwrites. That is, each block has the following properties: ID: Unchanged Sequence number: Previous value plus one. Write the nth block. The nth block includes all appended data, if any. As with the other blocks, its ID is unchanged and its sequence number is incremented. Appended data can only be written to the end of the file. That is, \"holes\" are not supported. Garbage collection When the file system is too full to accommodate a write operation, the system must perform garbage collection to make room. The garbage collection procedure is described below: The non-scratch area with the lowest garbage collection sequence number is selected as the \"source area.\" If there are other areas with the same sequence number, the one with the smallest flash offset is selected. The source area's ID is written to the scratch area's header, transforming it into a non-scratch ID. This former scratch area is now known as the \"destination area.\" The RAM representation is exhaustively searched for collectible objects. The following procedure is applied to each inode in the system: If the inode is resident in the source area, copy the inode record to the destination area. If the inode is a file inode, walk the inode's list of data blocks, starting with the last block in the file. Each block that is resident in the source area is copied to the destination area. If there is a run of two or more blocks that are resident in the source area, they are consolidated and copied to the destination area as a single new block (subject to the maximum block size restriction). The source area is reformatted as a scratch sector (i.e., is is fully erased, and its header is rewritten with an ID of 0xff). The area's garbage collection sequence number is incremented prior to rewriting the header. This area is now the new scratch sector.","title":"Internals"},{"location":"os/modules/fs/nffs/nffs_internals/#internals-of-nffs","text":"","title":"Internals of nffs"},{"location":"os/modules/fs/nffs/nffs_internals/#disk-structure","text":"On disk, each area is prefixed with the following header: /** On-disk representation of an area header. */ struct nffs_disk_area { uint32_t nda_magic [ 4 ]; /* NFFS_AREA_MAGIC{0,1,2,3} */ uint32_t nda_length ; /* Total size of area, in bytes. */ uint8_t nda_ver ; /* Current nffs version: 0 */ uint8_t nda_gc_seq ; /* Garbage collection count. */ uint8_t reserved8 ; uint8_t nda_id ; /* 0xff if scratch area. */ }; Beyond its header, an area contains a sequence of disk objects, representing the contents of the file system.

For most file operations, the reversed block list must be walked backwards. This introduces a number of speed inefficiencies: All data blocks must be read to determine the length of the file. Data blocks often need to be processed sequentially. The reversed nature of the block list transforms this from linear time to an O(n^2) operation. Furthermore, obtaining information about any constituent data block requires a separate flash read.","title":"RAM representation"},{"location":"os/modules/fs/nffs/nffs_internals/#inode-cache-and-data-block-cache","text":"The speed issues are addressed by a pair of caches. Cached inodes entries contain the file length and a much more convenient doubly-linked list of cached data blocks. The benefit of using caches is that the size of the caches need not be proportional to the size of the file system. In other words, caches can address speed efficiency concerns without negatively impacting the file system's scalability. nffs requires both caches during normal operation, so it is not possible to disable them. However, the cache sizes are configurable, and both caches can be configured with a size of one if RAM usage must be minimized. The following data structures are used in the inode and data block caches. /** Full data block representation; not stored permanently in RAM. */ struct nffs_block { struct nffs_hash_entry *nb_hash_entry ; /* Points to real block entry. */ uint32_t nb_seq ; /* Sequence number; greater supersedes lesser. */ struct nffs_inode_entry *nb_inode_entry ; /* Owning inode. */ struct nffs_hash_entry *nb_prev ; /* Previous block in file. */ uint16_t nb_data_len ; /* # of data bytes in block. */ uint16_t reserved16 ; }; /** Represents a single cached data block. */ struct nffs_cache_block { TAILQ_ENTRY ( nffs_cache_block ) ncb_link ; /* Next / prev cached block. */ struct nffs_block ncb_block ; /* Full data block. */ uint32_t ncb_file_offset ; /* File offset of this block. */ }; /** Full inode representation; not stored permanently in RAM. */ struct nffs_inode { struct nffs_inode_entry *ni_inode_entry ; /* Points to real inode entry. */ uint32_t ni_seq ; /* Sequence number; greater supersedes lesser. */ struct nffs_inode_entry *ni_parent ; /* Points to parent directory. */ uint8_t ni_filename_len ; /* # chars in filename. */ uint8_t ni_filename [ NFFS_SHORT_FILENAME_LEN ]; /* First 3 bytes. */ }; /** Doubly-linked tail queue of cached blocks; contained in cached inodes. */ TAILQ_HEAD ( nffs_block_cache_list , nffs_block_cache_entry ); /** Represents a single cached file inode. */ struct nffs_cache_inode { TAILQ_ENTRY ( nffs_cache_inode ) nci_link ; /* Sorted; LRU at tail. */ struct nffs_inode nci_inode ; /* Full inode. */ struct nffs_cache_block_list nci_block_list ; /* List of cached blocks. */ uint32_t nci_file_size ; /* Total file size. */ }; Only file inodes are cached; directory inodes are never cached. Within a cached inode, all cached data blocks are contiguous. E.g., if the start and end of a file are cached, then the middle must also be cached. A data block is only cached if its owning file is also cached. Internally, cached inodes are stored in a singly-linked list, ordered by time of use. The most-recently-used entry is the first element in the list. If a new inode needs to be cached, but the inode cache is full, the least-recently-used entry is freed to make room for the new one. The following operations cause an inode to be cached: Querying a file's length. Seeking within a file. Reading from a file. Writing to a file. The following operations cause a data block to be cached: Reading from the block. Writing to the block. If one of the above operations is applied to a data block that is not currently cached, nffs uses the following procedure to cache the necessary block: If none of the owning inode's blocks are currently cached, allocate a cached block entry corresponding to the requested block and insert it into the inode's list. Else if the requested file offset is less than that of the first cached block, bridge the gap between the inode's sequence of cached blocks and the block that now needs to be cached. This is accomplished by caching each block in the gap, finishing with the requested block. Else (the requested offset is beyond the end of the cache), If the requested offset belongs to the block that immediately follows the end of the cache, cache the block and append it to the list. Else, clear the cache, and populate it with the single entry corresponding to the requested block. If the system is unable to allocate a cached block entry at any point during the above procedure, the system frees up other blocks currently in the cache. This is accomplished as follows: Iterate the inode cache in reverse (i.e., start with the least-recently-used entry). For each entry: If the entry's cached block list is empty, advance to the next entry. Else, free all the cached blocks in the entry's list. Because the system imposes a minimum block cache size of one, the above procedure will always reclaim at least one cache block entry. The above procedure may result in the freeing of the block list that belongs to the very inode being operated on. This is OK, as the final block to get cached is always the block being requested.","title":"Inode cache and Data Block cache"},{"location":"os/modules/fs/nffs/nffs_internals/#detection","text":"The file system detection process consists of scanning a specified set of flash regions for valid nffs areas, and then populating the RAM representation of the file system with the detected objects. Detection is initiated with the nffs_detect() function. Not every area descriptor passed to nffs_detect() needs to reference a valid nffs area. Detection is successful as long as a complete file system is detected somewhere in the specified regions of flash. If an application is unsure where a file system might be located, it can initiate detection across the entire flash region. A detected file system is valid if: At least one non-scratch area is present. At least one scratch area is present (only the first gets used if there is more than one). The root directory inode is present. During detection, each indicated region of flash is checked for a valid area header. The contents of each valid non-scratch area are then restored into the nffs RAM representation. The following procedure is applied to each object in the area: Verify the object's integrity via a crc16 check. If invalid, the object is discarded and the procedure restarts on the next object in the area. Convert the disk object into its corresponding RAM representation and insert it into the hash table. If the object is an inode, its reference count is initialized to 1, indicating ownership by its parent directory. If an object with the same ID is already present, then one supersedes the other. Accept the object with the greater sequence number and discard the other. If the object references a nonexistent inode (parent directory in the case of an inode; owning file in the case of a data block), insert a temporary \"dummy\" inode into the hash table so that inter-object links can be maintained until the absent inode is eventually restored. Dummy inodes are identified by a reference count of 0. If a delete record for an inode is encountered, the inode's parent pointer is set to null to indicate that it should be removed from RAM. If nffs encounters an object that cannot be identified (i.e., its magic number is not valid), it scans the remainder of the flash area for the next valid magic number. Upon encountering a valid object, nffs resumes the procedure described above. After all areas have been restored, a sweep is performed across the entire RAM representation so that invalid inodes can be deleted from memory. For each directory inode: If its reference count is 0 (i.e., it is a dummy), migrate its children to the /lost+found directory, and delete it from the RAM representation. This should only happen in the case of file system corruption. If its parent reference is null (i.e., it was deleted), delete it and all its children from the RAM representation. For each file inode: If its reference count is 0 (i.e., it is a dummy), delete it from the RAM representation. This should only happen in the case of file system corruption. (We should try to migrate the file to the lost+found directory in this case, as mentioned in the todo section). When an object is deleted during this sweep, it is only deleted from the RAM representation; nothing is written to disk. When objects are migrated to the lost+found directory, their parent inode reference is permanently updated on the disk. In addition, a single scratch area is identified during the detection process. The first area whose fda_id value is set to 0xff is designated as the file system scratch area. If no valid scratch area is found, the cause could be that the system was restarted while a garbage collection cycle was in progress. Such a condition is identified by the presence of two areas with the same ID. In such a case, the shorter of the two areas is erased and designated as the scratch area.","title":"Detection"},{"location":"os/modules/fs/nffs/nffs_internals/#formatting","text":"A new nffs file system is created via formatting.

Description Contains the basic operations to set and read General Purpose Digital I/O Pins within a Mynewt system. Individual GPIOs are referenced in the APIs as pins . However, in this interface the pins are virtual GPIO pins. The MCU header file maps these virtual pins to the physical GPIO ports and pins. Typically, the BSP code may define named I/O pins in terms of these virtual pins to describe the devices attached to the physical pins. Here's a brief example so you can get the gist of the translation. Suppose my product uses the stm32F4xx processor. There already exists support for this processor within Mynewt. The processor has N ports (A,B,C..) of 16 GPIO pins per port. The MCU hal_gpio driver maps these to a set of virtual pins 0-N where port A maps to 0-15, Port B maps to 16-31, Port C maps to 32-47 and so on. The exact number of physical port (and virtual port pins) depends on the specific variant of the stm32F4xx. So if I want to turn on port B pin 3, that would be virtual pin 1*16 + 3 = 19. This translation is defined in the MCU implementation of hal_gpio.c for the stmf32F4xx. Each MCU will typically have a different translation method depending on its GPIO architecture. Now, when writing a BSP, it's common to give names to the relevant port pins that you are using. Thus, the BSP may define a mapping between a function and a virtual port pin in the bsp.h header file for the BSP. For example, #define SYSTEM_LED (37) #define FLASH_SPI_CHIP_SELECT (3) would map the system indicator LED to virtual pin 37 which on the stm32F4xx would be Port C pin 5 and the chip select line for the external SPI flash to virtual pin 3 which on the stm32F4xxis port A pin 3.

Description An Inter-Integrated Circuit (I\u00b2C ] I-squared-C) bus is a multi-master, multi-save serial interface used to connect components on a circuit board and often peripherals devices located off the circuit board. I2C is often though of as a 2-wire protocol because it uses two wires (SDA, SCL) to send data between devices. For a detailed description of I2C, see the I\u00b2C wikipedia page Definition hal_i2c.h HAL_I2C Theory Of Operation An I\u00b2C transaction typically involves acquiring the bus, sending and/or receiving data and release the bus. The bus acquisition portion is important because the bus is typically multi-master so other devices may be trying to read/write the same peripheral. HAL_I2C implements a master interface to the I\u00b2C bus. Typical usage of the interface would involve the following steps. Initialize an i2c device with: hal_i2c_init() When you wish to perform an i2c transaction, you call one or both of: hal_i2c_master_write(); hal_i2c_master_read(); These functions will issue a START condition, followed by the device's 7-bit I2C address, and then send or receive the payload based on the data provided. This will cause a repeated start on the bus, which is valid in I2C specification, and the decision to use repeated starts was made to simplify the I2C HAL. To set the STOP condition at an appropriate moment, you set the last_op field to a 1 in either function. For example, in an I2C memory access you might write a register address and then read data back via: hal_i2c_write(); -- write to a specific register on the device hal_i2c_read(); --- read back data, setting 'last_op' to '1' An addition API was added called hal_i2c_probe . This command combines hal_i2c_begin() , hal_i2c_read , and hal_i2c_end() to try to read 0-bytes from a specific bus address. its intended to provide an easy way to probe the bus for a specific device. NOTE: if the device is write-only, it will not appear with this command. A slave API is pending for further release. HAL_I2C Data Data to read/write is passed to the hal_i2c APIs via the struct hal_i2c_master_data { uint8_t address; /* destination address */ uint16_t len; /* number of bytes to transmit or receive */ uint8_t *buffer; /* data buffer for transmit or receive */ }; buffer is a pointer to the data to send. len is the number of bytes to send over the bus. address is a 7-bit bus address of the device. When I\u00b2C builds its address, it uses the 7-bit address plus a 1-bit R/W (read/write) indicator to identify the device and direction of the transaction. Thus when using this API, you should use a 7-bit address in the data structure and ensure that address is a value between 0-127. As an example, consider an I\u00b2C device address that looks like this: B7 B6 B5 B4 B3 B2 B1 B0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 R/W MSB LSB In the HAL_I2C API you would communicate with this device with address 0b1000110 , which is hex 0x46 or decimal 70. The I\u00b2C drive would add the R/W bit and transmit it as hex 0x8C (binary 10001100) or 0x8D (binary 10001101) depending whether it was a read or write command.","title":"I2C"},{"location":"os/modules/hal/hal_i2c/hal_i2c/#hal_i2c","text":"The hardware independent interface to I2C Devices.","title":"hal_i2c"},{"location":"os/modules/hal/hal_i2c/hal_i2c/#description","text":"An Inter-Integrated Circuit (I\u00b2C ] I-squared-C) bus is a multi-master, multi-save serial interface used to connect components on a circuit board and often peripherals devices located off the circuit board.

SPI slave functionality is supported in non-blocking mode. Definition hal_spi.h HAL_SPI Theory Of Operation SPI is called a 4-wire interface because of the 4 signals, MISO, MOSI, CLK, and SS. The SS signal (slave select) is an active low signal that activates a SPI slave device. This is how a master \"addresses\" a particular slave device. Often this signal is also referred to as \"chip select\" as it selects particular slave device for communications. The Mynewt SPI HAL has blocking and non-blocking transfers. Blocking means that the API call to transfer a byte will wait until the byte completes transmissions before the function returns. Blocking interface can be used for only the master slave SPI type. Non-blocking means he function returns control to the execution environment immediately after the API call and a callback function is executed at the completion of the transmission. Non-blocking interface can be used for both master and slave SPI types. The hal_spi_config method in the API above allows the SPI to be configured with appropriate settings for master or slave. It Must be called after the spi is initialized (i.e. after hal_spi_init is called) and when the spi is disabled (i.e. user must call hal_spi_disable if the spi has been enabled through hal_spi_enable prior to calling this function).

It allows packages to define their own log streams with separate names. It also allows an application to control the output destination of logs. Description In the Mynewt OS, the log package comes in two versions: The sys/log/full package implements the complete log functionality and API. The sys/log/stub package implements stubs for the API. Both packages export the log API, and any package that uses the log API must list log as a requirement in its pkg.yml file as follows: pkg.req_apis: - log The application's pkg.yml file specifies the version of the log package to use. A project that requires the full logging capability must list the sys/log/full package as a dependency in its pkg.yml file: pkg.deps: - sys/log/full You can use the sys/log/stub package if you want to build your application without logging to reduce code size. Compile Time Settings To save space at compile time, there is a compile time log level that includes/excludes certain logs at compile time, saving image space. For example, during debug, you can have significant logs present, but disable these at compile time to ensure the code size limits are met. A compiler flag LOG_LEVEL can be set in your target.cflags or within your app pkg.cflags files to set the compile time log level. The log level are defined in /sys/log/full/include/log/log.h but must be added by number to your yml file. For example: pkg.cflags -DLOG_LEVEL=3 or newt target set my_target cflags=-DLOG_LEVEL=3 would both set the compile-time log level to LOG_LEVEL_ERROR . All logs of less than LOG_LEVEL_ERROR severity would be disabled at compile time and take no space within the Mynewt application image. These compile time settings are applicable to all logs registered with the system. Log Each log stream requires a log structure to define its logging properties. Log Handler To use logs, a log handler that handles the I/O from the log is required. The log package comes with three pre-built log handlers: console -- streams log events directly to the console port. Does not support walking and reading. cbmem -- writes/reads log events to a circular buffer. Supports walking and reading for access by newtmgr and shell commands. fcb -- writes/reads log events to a flash circular buffer . Supports walking and reading for access by newtmgr and shell commands. In addition, it is possible to create custom log handlers for other methods. Examples may include Flash file system Flat flash buffer Streamed over some other interface To use logging, you typically do not need to create your own log handler. You can use one of the pre-built ones. A package or an application must define a variable of type struct log and register a log handler for it with the log package. It must call the log_register() function to specify the log handler to use: log_register ( char *name , struct log *log , const struct log_handler *lh , void *arg , uint8_t level ) The parameters are: name - Name of the log stream. log - Log instance to register, lh - Pointer to the log handler. You can specify one of the pre-built ones: &log_console_handler for console &log_cbm_handler for circular buffer &log_fcb_handler for flash circular buffer arg - Opaque argument that the specified log handler uses. The value of this argument depends on the log handler you specify: NULL for the log_console_handler . Pointer to an initialized cbmem structure (see util/cbmem package) for the log_cbm_handler . Pointer to an initialized fcb_log structure (see fs/fcb package) for the log_fcb_handler . Typically, a package that uses logging defines a global variable, such as my_package_log , of type struct log . The package can call the log_register() function with default values, but usually an application will override the logging properties and where to log to. There are two ways a package can allow an application to override the values: Define system configuration settings that an application can set and the package can then call the log_register() function with the configuration values. Make the my_package_log variable external and let the application call the log_register() function to specify a log handler for its specific purpose. Configuring Logging for Packages that an Application Uses Here is an example of how an application can set the log handlers for the logs of the packages that the application includes. In this example, the package1 package defines the variable package1_log of type struct log and externs the variable. Similarly, the package2 package defines the variable package2_log and externs the variable. The application sets logs for package1 to use console and sets logs for package2 to use a circular buffer. #include <package1/package1.h> #include <package2/package2.h> #include <util/cbmem.h> #include <log/log.h> static uint32_t cbmem_buf [ MAX_CBMEM_BUF ]; static struct cbmem cbmem ; void app_log_init ( void ) { log_register ( \"package1_log\" , &package1_log , &log_console_handler , NULL , LOG_SYSLEVEL ); cbmem_init ( &cbmem , cbmem_buf , MAX_CBMEM_BUF ); log_register ( \"package2_log\" , &package2_log , &log_cbmem_handler , &cbmem , LOG_SYSLEVEL ); } Implementing a Package that Uses Logging This example shows how a package logs to console.

The log package comes with three pre-built log handlers: console -- streams log events directly to the console port.

Supports walking and reading for access by newtmgr and shell commands. fcb -- writes/reads log events to a flash circular buffer . Supports walking and reading for access by newtmgr and shell commands. In addition, it is possible to create custom log handlers for other methods. Examples may include Flash file system Flat flash buffer Streamed over some other interface To use logging, you typically do not need to create your own log handler. You can use one of the pre-built ones. A package or an application must define a variable of type struct log and register a log handler for it with the log package. It must call the log_register() function to specify the log handler to use: log_register ( char *name , struct log *log , const struct log_handler *lh , void *arg , uint8_t level ) The parameters are: name - Name of the log stream. log - Log instance to register, lh - Pointer to the log handler. You can specify one of the pre-built ones: &log_console_handler for console &log_cbm_handler for circular buffer &log_fcb_handler for flash circular buffer arg - Opaque argument that the specified log handler uses. The value of this argument depends on the log handler you specify: NULL for the log_console_handler . Pointer to an initialized cbmem structure (see util/cbmem package) for the log_cbm_handler . Pointer to an initialized fcb_log structure (see fs/fcb package) for the log_fcb_handler . Typically, a package that uses logging defines a global variable, such as my_package_log , of type struct log . The package can call the log_register() function with default values, but usually an application will override the logging properties and where to log to. There are two ways a package can allow an application to override the values: Define system configuration settings that an application can set and the package can then call the log_register() function with the configuration values.

By isolating upgrade functionality to a separate image, the application can support over-the-air upgrade without dedicating flash space to network stack and management code. Concept Mynewt supports three image setups: Setup Description Single One large image; upgrade not supported. Unified Two standalone images. Split Kernel in slot 0; application in slot 1. Each setup has its tradeoffs. The Single setup gives you the most flash space, but doesn't allow you to upgrade after manufacturing. The Unified setup allows for a complete failover in case a bad image gets uploaded, but requires a lot of redundancy in each image, limiting the amount of flash available to the application. The Split setup sits somewhere between these two options. Before exploring the split setup in more detail, it might be helpful to get a basic understanding of the Mynewt boot sequence. The boot process is summarized below. Boot Sequence - Single In the Single setup, there is no boot loader. Instead, the image is placed at address 0. The hardware boots directly into the image code. Upgrade is not possible because there is no boot loader to move an alternate image into place. Boot Sequence - Unified In the Unified setup, the boot loader is placed at address 0. At startup, the boot loader arranges for the correct image to be in image slot 0, which may entail swapping the contents of the two image slots. Finally, the boot loader jumps to the image in slot 0. Boot Sequence - Split The Split setup differs from the other setups mainly in that a target is not fully contained in a single image. Rather, the target is partitioned among two separate images: the loader , and the application . Functionality is divided among these two images as follows: Loader: Mynewt OS. Network stack for connectivity during upgrade e.g. BLE stack. Anything else required for image upgrade. Application: Parts of Mynewt not required for image upgrade. Application-specific code. The loader image serves three purposes: Second-stage boot loader: it jumps into the application image at start up. Image upgrade server: the user can upgrade to a new loader + application combo, even if an application image is not currently running. Functionality container: the application image can directly access all the code present in the loader image From the perspective of the boot loader, a loader image is identical to a plain unified image. What makes a loader image different is a change to its start up sequence: rather than starting the Mynewt OS, it jumps to the application image in slot 1 if one is present. Tutorial Building a Split Image We will be referring to the nRF51dk for examples in this document. Let's take a look at this board's flash map (defined in hw/bsp/nrf51dk/bsp.yml ): Name Offset Size (kB) Boot loader 0x00000000 16 Reboot log 0x00004000 16 Image slot 0 0x00008000 110 Image slot 1 0x00023800 110 Image scratch 0x0003f000 2 Flash file system 0x0003f800 2 The application we will be building is bleprph . First, we create a target to tie our BSP and application together. newt target create bleprph-nrf51dk newt target set bleprph-nrf51dk \\ app=@apache-mynewt-core/apps/bleprph \\ bsp=@apache-mynewt-core/hw/bsp/nrf51dk \\ build_profile=optimized \\ syscfg=BLE_LL_CFG_FEAT_LE_ENCRYPTION=0:BLE_SM_LEGACY=0 The two syscfg settings disable bluetooth security and keep the code size down. We can verify the target using the target show command: [~/tmp/myproj2]$ newt target show bleprph-nrf51dk targets/bleprph-nrf51dk app=@apache-mynewt-core/apps/bleprph bsp=@apache-mynewt-core/hw/bsp/nrf51dk build_profile=optimized syscfg=BLE_LL_CFG_FEAT_LE_ENCRYPTION=0:BLE_SM_LEGACY=0 Next, build the target: [~/tmp/myproj2]$ newt build bleprph-nrf51dk Building target targets/bleprph-nrf51dk # [...] Target successfully built: targets/bleprph-nrf51dk With our target built, we can view a code size breakdown using the newt size <target> command. In the interest of brevity, the smaller entries are excluded from the below output: [~/tmp/myproj2]$ newt size bleprph-nrf51dk Size of Application Image: app FLASH RAM 2446 1533 apps_bleprph.a 1430 104 boot_bootutil.a 1232 0 crypto_mbedtls.a 1107 0 encoding_cborattr.a 2390 0 encoding_tinycbor.a 1764 0 fs_fcb.a 2959 697 hw_drivers_nimble_nrf51.a 4126 108 hw_mcu_nordic_nrf51xxx.a 8161 4049 kernel_os.a 2254 38 libc_baselibc.a 2612 0 libgcc.a 2232 24 mgmt_imgmgr.a 1499 44 mgmt_newtmgr_nmgr_os.a 23918 1930 net_nimble_controller.a 28537 2779 net_nimble_host.a 2207 205 sys_config.a 1074 197 sys_console_full.a 3268 97 sys_log.a 1296 0 time_datetime.a objsize text data bss dec hex filename 105592 1176 13392 120160 1d560 /home/me/tmp/myproj2/bin/targets/bleprph-nrf51dk/app/apps/bleprph/bleprph.elf The full image text size is about 103kB (where 1kB = 1024 bytes). With an image slot size of 110kB, this leaves only about 7kB of flash for additional application code and data. Not good. This is the situation we would be facing if we were using the Unified setup. The Split setup can go a long way in solving our problem. Our unified bleprph image consists mostly of components that get used during an image upgrade. By using the Split setup, we turn the unified image into two separate images: the loader and the application. The functionality related to image upgrade can be delegated to the loader image, freeing up a significant amount of flash in the application image slot. Let's create a new target to use with the Split setup. We designate a target as a split target by setting the loader variable. In our example, we are going to use bleprph as the loader, and splitty as the application. bleprph makes sense as a loader because it contains the BLE stack and everything else required for an image upgrade. newt target create split-nrf51dk newt target set split-nrf51dk \\ loader=@apache-mynewt-core/apps/bleprph \\ app=@apache-mynewt-core/apps/splitty \\ bsp=@apache-mynewt-core/hw/bsp/nrf51dk \\ build_profile=optimized \\ syscfg=BLE_LL_CFG_FEAT_LE_ENCRYPTION=0:BLE_SM_LEGACY=0 Verify that the target looks correct: [~/tmp/myproj2]$ newt target show split-nrf51dk targets/split-nrf51dk app=@apache-mynewt-core/apps/splitty bsp=@apache-mynewt-core/hw/bsp/nrf51dk build_profile=optimized loader=@apache-mynewt-core/apps/bleprph syscfg=BLE_LL_CFG_FEAT_LE_ENCRYPTION=0:BLE_SM_LEGACY=0 Now, let's build the new target: [~/tmp/myproj2]$ newt build split-nrf51dk Building target targets/split-nrf51dk # [...] Target successfully built: targets/split-nrf51dk And look at the size breakdown (again, smaller entries are removed): [~/tmp/myproj2]$ newt size split-nrf51dk Size of Application Image: app FLASH RAM 3064 251 sys_shell.a objsize text data bss dec hex filename 4680 112 17572 22364 575c /home/me/tmp/myproj2/bin/targets/split-nrf51dk/app/apps/splitty/splitty.elf Size of Loader Image: loader FLASH RAM 2446 1533 apps_bleprph.a 1430 104 boot_bootutil.a 1232 0 crypto_mbedtls.a 1107 0 encoding_cborattr.a 2390 0 encoding_tinycbor.a 1764 0 fs_fcb.a 3168 705 hw_drivers_nimble_nrf51.a 4318 109 hw_mcu_nordic_nrf51xxx.a 8285 4049 kernel_os.a 2274 38 libc_baselibc.a 2612 0 libgcc.a 2232 24 mgmt_imgmgr.a 1491 44 mgmt_newtmgr_nmgr_os.a 25169 1946 net_nimble_controller.a 31397 2827 net_nimble_host.a 2259 205 sys_config.a 1318 202 sys_console_full.a 3424 97 sys_log.a 1053 60 sys_stats.a 1296 0 time_datetime.a objsize text data bss dec hex filename 112020 1180 13460 126660 1eec4 /home/me/tmp/myproj2/bin/targets/split-nrf51dk/loader/apps/bleprph/bleprph.elf The size command shows two sets of output: one for the application, and another for the loader. The addition of the split functionality did make bleprph slightly bigger, but notice how small the application is: 4.5 kB! Where before we only had 7 kB left, now we have 105.5 kB. Furthermore, all the functionality in the loader is available to the application at any time. For example, if your application needs bluetooth functionality, it can use the BLE stack present in the loader instead of containing its own copy. Finally, let's deploy the split image to our nRF51dk board. The procedure here is the same as if we were using the Unified setup, i.e., via either the newt load or newt run command. [~/repos/mynewt/core]$ newt load split-nrf51dk 0 Loading app image into slot 2 Loading loader image into slot 1 Image Management Retrieve Current State (image list) Image management in the split setup is a bit more complicated than in the unified setup. You can determine a device's image management state with the newtmgr image list command. Here is how a device responds to this command after our loader + application combo has been deployed: [~/tmp/myproj2]$ newtmgr -c A600ANJ1 image list Images: slot=0 version: 0.0.0 bootable: true flags: active confirmed hash: 948f118966f7989628f8f3be28840fd23a200fc219bb72acdfe9096f06c4b39b slot=1 version: 0.0.0 bootable: false flags: hash: 78e4d263eeb5af5635705b7cae026cc184f14aa6c6c59c6e80616035cd2efc8f Split status: matching There are several interesting things about this response: Two images: This is expected; we deployed both a loader image and an application image. bootable flag: Notice slot 0's bootable flag is set, while slot 1's is not. This tells us that slot 0 contains a loader and slot 1 contains an application. If an image is bootable, it can be booted directly from the boot loader. Non-bootable images can only be started from a loader image. flags: Slot 0 is active and confirmed ; none of slot 1's flags are set. The active flag indicates that the image is currently running; the confirmed flag indicates that the image will continue to be used on subsequent reboots. Slot 1's lack of enabled flags indicates that the image is not being used at all. Split status: The split status field tells you if the loader and application are compatible. A loader + application combo is compatible only if both images were built at the same time with newt . If the loader and application are not compatible, the loader will not boot into the application. Enabling a Split Application By default, the application image in slot 1 is disabled. This is indicated in the image list response above. When you deploy a loader / application combo to your device, the application image won't actually run. Instead, the loader will act as though an application image is not present and remain in \"loader mode\". Typically, a device in loader mode simply acts as an image management server, listening for an image upgrade or a request to activate the application image. Use the following command sequence to enable the split application image: Tell device to \"test out\" the application image on next boot ( newtmgr image test <application-image-hash> ). Reboot device ( newtmgr reset ). Make above change permanent ( newtmgr image confirm ). After the above sequence, a newtmgr image list command elicits the following response: [~/tmp/myproj2]$ newtmgr -c A600ANJ1 image confirm Images: slot=0 version: 0.0.0 bootable: true flags: active confirmed hash: 948f118966f7989628f8f3be28840fd23a200fc219bb72acdfe9096f06c4b39b slot=1 version: 0.0.0 bootable: false flags: active confirmed hash: 78e4d263eeb5af5635705b7cae026cc184f14aa6c6c59c6e80616035cd2efc8f Split status: matching The active confirmed flags value on both slots indicates that both images are permanently running. Image Upgrade First, let's review of the image upgrade process for the Unified setup. The user upgrades to a new image in this setup with the following steps: Image Upgrade - Unified Upload new image to slot 1 ( newtmgr image upload <filename> ). Tell device to \"test out\" the new image on next boot ( newtmgr image test <image-hash> ). Reboot device ( newtmgr reset ). Make new image permanent ( newtmgr image confirm ). Image Upgrade - Split The image upgrade process is a bit more complicated in the Split setup. It is more complicated because two images need to be upgraded (loader and application) rather than just one. The split upgrade process is described below: Disable split functionality; we need to deactivate the application image in slot 1 ( newtmgr image test <current-loader-hash> ). Reboot device ( newtmgr reset ). Make above change permanent ( newtmgr image confirm ). Upload new loader to slot 1 ( newtmgr image upload <filename> ). Tell device to \"test out\" the new loader on next boot ( newtmgr image test <new-loader-hash> ). Reboot device ( newtmgr reset ). Make above change of loader permanent ( newtmgr image confirm ). Upload new application to slot 1 ( newtmgr image upload <filename> ). Tell device to \"test out\" the new application on next boot ( newtmgr image test <new-application-hash> ). Reboot device ( newtmgr reset ). Make above change of application permanent ( newtmgr image confirm ). When performing this process manually, it may be helpful to use image list to check the image management state as you go. Syscfg Syscfg is Mynewt's system-wide configuration mechanism. In a split setup, there is a single umbrella syscfg configuration that applies to both the loader and the application. Consequently, overriding a value in an application-only package potentially affects the loader (and vice-versa). Loaders The following applications have been enabled as loaders. You may choose to build your own loader application, and these can serve as samples. @apache-mynewt-core/apps/slinky @apache-mynewt-core/apps/bleprph Split Apps The following applications have been enabled as split applications. If you choose to build your own split application these can serve as samples. Note that slinky can be either a loader image or an application image. @apache-mynewt-core/apps/slinky @apache-mynewt-core/apps/splitty Theory of Operation A split image is built as follows: First newt builds the application and loader images separately to ensure they are consistent (no errors) and to generate elf files which can inform newt of the symbols used by each part. Then newt collects the symbols used by both application and loader in two ways. It collects the set of symbols from the .elf files. It also collects all the possible symbols from the .a files for each application. Newt builds the set of packages that the two applications share. It ensures that all the symbols used in those packages are matching. NOTE: because of features and #ifdefs, its possible for the two package to have symbols that are not the same. In this case newt generates an error and will not build a split image. Then newt creates the list of symbols that the two applications share from those packages (using the .elf files). Newt re-links the loader to ensure all of these symbols are present in the loader application (by forcing the linker to include them in the .elf ). Newt builds a special copy of the loader.elf with only these symbols (and the handful of symbols discussed in the linking section above). Finally, newt links the application, replacing the common .a libraries with the special loader.elf image during the link.","title":"toc"},{"location":"os/modules/split/split/#split-images","text":"","title":"Split Images"},{"location":"os/modules/split/split/#description","text":"The split image mechanism divides a target into two separate images: one capable of image upgrade; the other containing application code.

The Unified setup allows for a complete failover in case a bad image gets uploaded, but requires a lot of redundancy in each image, limiting the amount of flash available to the application.

The loader image serves three purposes: Second-stage boot loader: it jumps into the application image at start up. Image upgrade server: the user can upgrade to a new loader + application combo, even if an application image is not currently running. Functionality container: the application image can directly access all the code present in the loader image From the perspective of the boot loader, a loader image is identical to a plain unified image.

This allows easy integration of statistics for troubleshooting, maintenance, and usage monitoring. By creating and registering your statistics, they are automatically included in the Newtmgr shell and console APIs. Implementation Details A statistic is an unsigned integer that can be set by the code. When building stats, the implementer chooses the size of the statistic depending on the frequency of the statistic and the resolution required before the counter wraps. Typically the stats are incremented upon code events; however, they are not limted to that purpose. Stats are organized into sections. Each section of stats has its own name and can be queried separately through the API. Each section of stats also has its own statistic size, allowing the user to separate large (64-bit) statistics from small (16 bit statistics). NOTE: It is not currently possible to group different size stats into the same section. Please ensure all stats in a section have the same size. Stats sections are currently stored in a single global stats group. Statistics are stored in a simple structure which contains a small stats header followed by a list of stats. The stats header contains: struct stats_hdr { char *s_name ; uint8_t s_size ; uint8_t s_cnt ; uint16_t s_pad1 ; #ifdef STATS_NAME_ENABLE struct stats_name_map *s_map ; int s_map_cnt ; #endif STAILQ_ENTRY ( stats_hdr ) s_next ; }; Compile Time Options When building your app, there is a single compile time option for statistics. When querying statistics, they are always queried by number, but if you want to see the results by name, you need to define STATS_NAME_ENABLE . This is defined using pkg.clfags: -DSTATS_NAME_ENABLE in your apps pkg.yml file or target.clfags: -DSTATS_NAME_ENABLE in your target definition. Enabling stat names provides better descriptions in the reported stats, but takes code space to store the strings within the image. Adding Stats to your code.

Include the stats header file Define a stats section Declare an instance of the section Define the stat sections names table Implement stat in your code Initialize the stats Register the stats Include the stats header file Add the stats library to your pkg.yml file for your package or app by adding this line to your package dependencies. pkg.deps: - \"@apache-mynewt-core/sys/stats\" Add this include directive to code files using the stats library. #include <stats/stats.h> Define a stats section You must use the stats.h macros to define your stats table. A stats section definition looks like this. STATS_SECT_START(my_stat_section) STATS_SECT_ENTRY(attempt_stat) STATS_SECT_ENTRY(error_stat) STATS_SECT_END In this case we chose to make the stats 32-bits each. stats.h supports three different stats sizes through the following macros: STATS_SIZE_16 -- stats are 16 bits (wraps at 65536) STATS_SIZE_32 -- stats are 32 bits (wraps at 4294967296) STATS_SIZE_64 -- stats are 64-bits When this compiles/pre-processes, it produces a structure definition like this struct stats_my_stat_section { struct stats_hdr s_hdr; uint32_t sattempt_stat; uint32_t serror_stat; }; You can see that the defined structure has a small stats structure header and the two stats we have defined. Depending on whether these stats are used in multiple modules, you may need to include this definition in a header file. Declaring a variable to hold the stats Declare the global variable to hold your statistics. Since it is possible to have multiple copies of the same section (for example a stat section for each of 5 identical peripherals), the variable name of the stats section must be unique. STATS_SECT_DECL(my_stat_section) g_mystat; Again, if your stats section is used in multiple C files you will need to include the above definition in one of the C files and 'extern' this declaration in your header file. extern STATS_SECT_DECL(my_stat_section) g_mystat; Define the stats section name table Whether or not you are using STATS_NAME_ENABLE , you must define a stats name table. If STATS_NAME_ENABLE is not enabled, this will not take any code space or image size. /* define a few stats for querying */ STATS_NAME_START(my_stat_section) STATS_NAME(my_stat_section, attempt_stat) STATS_NAME(my_stat_section, error_stat) STATS_NAME_END(my_stat_section) When compiled by the preprocessor, it creates a structure that looks like this. struct stats_name_map g_stats_map_my_stat_section[] = { { __builtin_offsetof (struct stats_my_stat_section, sattempt_stat), \"attempt_stat\" }, { __builtin_offsetof (struct stats_my_stat_section, serror_stat), \"error_stat\" }, }; This table will allow the UI components to find a nice string name for the stat. Implement stats in your code. You can use the STATS_INC or STATS_INCN macros to increment your statistics within your C-code. For example, your code may do this: STATS_INC(g_mystat, attempt_stat); rc = do_task(); if(rc == ERR) { STATS_INC(g_mystat, error_stat); } Initialize the statistics You must initialize the stats so they can be operated on by the stats library. As per our example above, it would look like the following. This tells the system how large each statistic is and the number of statistics in the section. It also initialize the name information for the statistics if enabled as shown above. rc = stats_init( STATS_HDR(g_mystat), STATS_SIZE_INIT_PARMS(g_mystat, STATS_SIZE_32), STATS_NAME_INIT_PARMS(my_stat_section)); assert(rc == 0); Register the statistic section If you want the system to know about your stats, you must register them. rc = stats_register(\"my_stats\", STATS_HDR(g_mystat)); assert(rc == 0); There is also a method that does initialization and registration at the same time, called stats_init_and_reg . Retrieving stats through console or Newtmgr If you enable console in your project you can see stats through the serial port defined. This is the stats as shown from the example above with names enabled. stat my_stats 12274:attempt_stat: 3 12275:error_stat: 0 This is the stats as shown from the example without names enabled. stat my_stats 29149:s0: 3 29150:s1: 0 A note on multiple stats sections If you are implementing a device with multiple instances, you may want multiple stats sections with the exact same format. For example, suppose I write a driver for an external distance sensor. My driver supports up to 5 sensors and I want to record the stats of each device separately. This works identically to the example above, except you would need to register each one separately with a unique name. The stats system will not let two sections be entered with the same name.","title":"toc"},{"location":"os/modules/stats/stats/#statistics-module","text":"The statistics module allows application, libraries, or drivers to record statistics that can be shown via the Newtmgr tool and console.

When building stats, the implementer chooses the size of the statistic depending on the frequency of the statistic and the resolution required before the counter wraps.

Each section of stats has its own name and can be queried separately through the API. Each section of stats also has its own statistic size, allowing the user to separate large (64-bit) statistics from small (16 bit statistics). NOTE: It is not currently possible to group different size stats into the same section. Please ensure all stats in a section have the same size. Stats sections are currently stored in a single global stats group. Statistics are stored in a simple structure which contains a small stats header followed by a list of stats. The stats header contains: struct stats_hdr { char *s_name ; uint8_t s_size ; uint8_t s_cnt ; uint16_t s_pad1 ; #ifdef STATS_NAME_ENABLE struct stats_name_map *s_map ; int s_map_cnt ; #endif STAILQ_ENTRY ( stats_hdr ) s_next ; };","title":"Implementation Details"},{"location":"os/modules/stats/stats/#compile-time-options","text":"When building your app, there is a single compile time option for statistics.

The newt build <target-name> command validates the setting definitions and value overrides for all the packages in the target to ensure a valid and consistent build. It aborts the build when it detects violations or ambiguities between packages. The following sections describe the error conditions that newt detects and the error messages that it outputs. For most errors, newt also outputs the Setting history with the order of package overrides to help you resolve the errors. Note: The newt target config <target-name> command also detects errors and outputs error messages at the top of the command output. The command outputs the package setting definitions and values after it outputs the error messages. It is easy to miss the error messages at the top. Value Override Violations The newt tool uses package priorities to resolve override conflicts. It uses the value override from the highest priority package when multiple packages override the same setting. Newt checks for the following override violations: Ambiguity Violation - Two packages of the same priority override a setting with different values. And no higher priority package overrides the setting. Priority Violation - A package overrides a setting defined by a package with higher or equal priority. Example: Ambiguity Violation Error Message The following example shows the error message that newt outputs for an ambiguity violation: Error: Syscfg ambiguities detected: Setting: LOG_NEWTMGR, Packages: [apps/slinky, apps/splitty] Setting history (newest -> oldest): LOG_NEWTMGR: [apps/splitty:0, apps/slinky:1, sys/log/full:0] The above error occurs because the apps/slinky and apps/splitty packages in the split image target both override the same setting with different values. The apps/slinky package sets the sys/log/full package LOG_NEWTMGR setting to 1, and the apps/splitty package sets the setting to 0. The overrides are ambiguous because both are app packages and have the same priority. The following are excerpts of the defintion and the two overrides from the syscfg.yml files that cause the error: #Package: sys/log/full syscfg.defs: LOG_NEWTMGR: description: 'Enables or disables newtmgr command tool logging' value: 0 #Package: apps/slinky syscfg.vals: LOG_NEWTMGR: 1 #Package: apps/splitty syscfg.vals: LOG_NEWTMGR: 0 Example: Priority Violation Error Message The following example shows the error message that newt outputs for a priority violation where a package tries to change the setting that was defined by another package at the same priority level: Error: Priority violations detected (Packages can only override settings defined by packages of lower priority): Package: mgmt/newtmgr overriding setting: LOG_NEWTMGR defined by sys/log/full Setting history (newest -> oldest): LOG_NEWTMGR: [sys/log/full:0] The above error occurs because the mgmt/newtmgr lib package overrides the LOG_NEWTMGR setting that the sys/log/full lib package defines. The following are excerpts of the definition and the override from the syscfg.yml files that cause this error: #Package: sys/log/full syscfg.defs: LOG_NEWTMGR: description: 'Enables or disables newtmgr command tool logging' value: 0 #Package: mgmt/newtmgr syscfg.vals: LOG_NEWTMGR: 1 Flash Area Violations For flash_owner type setting definitions, newt checks for the following violations: An undefined flash area is assigned to a setting. A flash area is assigned to multiple settings. Example: Undefined Flash Area Error Message The following example shows the error message that newt outputs for an undefined flash area. Building target targets/sim_slinky Error: Flash errors detected: Setting REBOOT_LOG_FLASH_AREA specifies unknown flash area: FLASH_AREA_NOEXIST Setting history (newest -> oldest): REBOOT_LOG_FLASH_AREA: [hw/bsp/native:FLASH_AREA_NOEXIST, sys/reboot:] The above error occurs because the hw/bsp/native package assigns the undefined FLASH_AREA_NOEXIST flash area to the sys/reboot package REBOOT_LOG_FLASH_AREA setting. The following are excerpts of the definition and the override from the syscfg.yml files that cause the error: #Package: sys/reboot syscfg.defs: REBOOT_LOG_FLASH_AREA: description: 'Flash Area to use for reboot log.' type: flash_owner value: #Package: hw/bsp/native syscfg.vals: REBOOT_LOG_FLASH_AREA: FLASH_AREA_NOEXIST Example: Multiple Flash Area Assignment Error Message The following example shows the error message that newt outputs when multiple settings are assigned the same flash area: Error: Flash errors detected: Multiple flash_owner settings specify the same flash area settings: REBOOT_LOG_FLASH_AREA, CONFIG_FCB_FLASH_AREA flash area: FLASH_AREA_NFFS Setting history (newest -> oldest): CONFIG_FCB_FLASH_AREA: [hw/bsp/native:FLASH_AREA_NFFS, sys/config:] REBOOT_LOG_FLASH_AREA: [apps/slinky:FLASH_AREA_NFFS, sys/reboot:] The above error occurs because the hw/bsp/native package assigns the FLASH_AREA_NFFS flash area to the sys/config/ package CONFIG_FCB_FLASH_AREA setting, and the apps/slinky package also assigns FLASH_AREA_NFFS to the sys/reboot package REBOOT_LOG_FLASH_AREA setting. The following are excerpts of the two definitions and the two overrides from the syscfg.yml files that cause the error: # Package: sys/config syscfg.defs.CONFIG_FCB: CONFIG_FCB_FLASH_AREA: description: 'The flash area for the Config Flash Circular Buffer' type: 'flash_owner' value: # Package: sys/reboot syscfg.defs: REBOOT_LOG_FLASH_AREA: description: 'The flash area for the reboot log' type: 'flash_owner' value: #Package: hw/bsp/native syscfg.vals: CONFIG_FCB_FLASH_AREA: FLASH_AREA_NFFS #Package: apps/slinky syscfg.vals: REBOOT_LOG_FLASH_AREA: FLASH_AREA_NFFS Restriction Violations For setting definitions with restrictions specified, newt checks for the following violations: A setting with a $notnull restriction does not have a value. For a setting with expression restrictions, some required setting values in the expressions evaluate to false. Example: $notnull Restriction Violation Error Message The following example shows the error message that newt outputs when a setting with $notnull restriction does not have a value: Error: Syscfg restriction violations detected: NFFS_FLASH_AREA must not be null Setting history (newest -> oldest): NFFS_FLASH_AREA: [fs/nffs:] The above error occurs because the fs/nffs package defines the NFFS_FLASH_AREA setting with a $notnull restriction and no packages override the setting. The following is an excerpt of the definition in the syscfg.yml file that causes the error: #Package: fs/nffs syscfg.defs: NFFS_FLASH_AREA: description: 'The flash area to use for the Newtron Flash File System' type: flash_owner value: restrictions: - $notnull Example: Expression Restriction Violation Error Message The following example shows the error message that newt outputs for an expression restriction violation: Error: Syscfg restriction violations detected: CONFIG_FCB=1 requires CONFIG_FCB_FLASH_AREA be set, but CONFIG_FCB_FLASH_AREA= Setting history (newest -> oldest): CONFIG_FCB: [targets/sim_slinky:1, sys/config:0] CONFIG_FCB_FLASH_AREA: [sys/config:] The above error occurs because the sys/config package defines the CONFIG_FCB setting with a restriction that when set, requires that the CONFIG_FCB_FLASH_AREA setting must also be set. The following are excerpts of the definition and the override from the syscfg.yml files that cause the error: # Package: sys/config syscfg.defs: CONFIG_FCB: description: 'Uses Config Flash Circular Buffer' value: 0 restrictions: - '!CONFIG_NFFS' - 'CONFIG_FCB_FLASH_AREA' # Package: targets/sim_slinky syscfg.vals: CONFIG_FCB: 1 Task Priority Violations For task_priority type setting definitions, newt checks for the following violations: A task priority number is assigned to multiple settings. The task priority number is greater than 239. Example: Duplicate Task Priority Assignment Error Message The following example shows the error message that newt outputs when a task priority number is assigned to multiple settings. Note: The settings used in this example are not actual apps/slinky and sys/shell settings. These settings are created for this example because currently only one Mynewt package defines a task_priority type setting. Error: duplicate priority value: setting1=SHELL_TASK_PRIORITY setting2=SLINKY_TASK_PRIORITY pkg1=apps/slinky pkg2=sys/shell value=1 The above error occurs because the apps/slinky package defines a SLINKY_TASK_PRIORITY setting with a default task priority of 1 and the sys/shell package also defines a SHELL_TASK_PRIORITY setting with a default task priority of 1. Example: Invalid Task Priority Error Message The following example shows the error message that newt outputs when a setting is assigned an invalid task priority value: Error: invalid priority value: value too great (> 239); setting=SLINKY_TASK_PRIORITY value=240 pkg=apps/slinky The above error occurs because the apps/slinky package defines the SLINKY_TASK_PRIORITY setting with 240 for the default task priority value. Note: Newt does not output the Setting history with task priority violation error messages. Duplicate System Configuration Setting Definition A setting definition must be unique. Newt checks that only one package in the target defines a setting. The following example shows the error message that newt outputs when multiple packages define the LOG_NEWTMGR setting: Error: setting LOG_NEWTMGR redefined Note: Newt does not output the Setting history with duplicate setting error messages. Override of Undefined System Configuration Setting The newt build command ignores overrides of undefined system configuration settings. The command does not print a warning when you run it with the default log level. If you override a setting and the value is not assigned to the setting, you may have misspelled the setting name or a package no longer defines the setting. You have two options to troubleshoot this problem: Run the newt target config show command to see the configuration setting definitions and overrides. Run the newt build -ldebug command to build your target with DEBUG log level. Note: The newt build -ldebug command generates lots of output and we recommend that you use the newt target config show command option. Example: Ignoring Override of Undefined Setting Message The following example shows that the apps/slinky application overrides the LOG_NEWTMGR setting but omits the T as an example of an error and overrides the misspelled LOG_NEWMGR setting. Here is an excerpt from its syscfg.yml file: #package: apps/slinky syscfg.vals: # Enable the shell task. SHELL_TASK: 1 ... # Enable newtmgr commands. STATS_NEWTMGR: 1 LOG_NEWMGR: 1 The newt target config show slinky_sim command outputs the following WARNING message: 2017/02/18 17:19:12.119 [WARNING] Ignoring override of undefined settings: 2017/02/18 17:19:12.119 [WARNING] LOG_NEWMGR 2017/02/18 17:19:12.119 [WARNING] NFFS_FLASH_AREA 2017/02/18 17:19:12.119 [WARNING] Setting history (newest -> oldest): 2017/02/18 17:19:12.119 [WARNING] LOG_NEWMGR: [apps/slinky:1] 2017/02/18 17:19:12.119 [WARNING] NFFS_FLASH_AREA: [hw/bsp/native:FLASH_AREA_NFFS] The newt build -ldebug slinky_sim command outputs the following DEBUG message: 2017/02/18 17:06:21.451 [DEBUG] Ignoring override of undefined settings: 2017/02/18 17:06:21.451 [DEBUG] LOG_NEWMGR 2017/02/18 17:06:21.451 [DEBUG] NFFS_FLASH_AREA 2017/02/18 17:06:21.451 [DEBUG] Setting history (newest -> oldest): 2017/02/18 17:06:21.451 [DEBUG] LOG_NEWMGR: [apps/slinky:1] 2017/02/18 17:06:21.451 [DEBUG] NFFS_FLASH_AREA: [hw/bsp/native:FLASH_AREA_NFFS] BSP Package Overrides Undefined Configuration Settings You might see a warning that indicates your application's BSP package is overriding some undefined settings. As you can see from the previous example, the WARNING message shows that the hw/bsp/native package is overriding the undefined NFFS_FLASH_AREA setting. This is not an error because of the way a BSP package defines and assigns its flash areas to packages that use flash memory. A BSP package defines, in its bsp.yml file, a flash area map of the flash areas on the board. A package that uses flash memory must define a flash area configuration setting name. The BSP package overrides the package's flash area setting with one of the flash areas from its flash area map. A BSP package overrides the flash area settings for all packages that use flash memory because it does not know the packages that an application uses. When an application does not include one of these packages, the flash area setting for the package is undefined. You will see a message that indicates the BSP package overrides this undefined setting. Here are excerpts from the hw/bsp/native package's bsp.yml and syscfg.yml files for the slinky_sim target. The BSP package defines the flash area map in its bsp.yml file and overrides the flash area settings for all packages in its syscfg.yml file. The slinky_sim target does not use the fs/nffs package which defines the NFFS_FLASH_AREA setting.

It shows you how to tell Mynewt to use default or customized values to initialize packages that you develop or use to build a target. This guide: Assumes you have read the Concepts section that describes the Mynewt package hierarchy and its use of the pkg.yml and syscfg.yml files. Assumes you have read the Newt Tool Theory of Operation and are familiar with how newt determines package dependencies for your target build. Covers only the system initialization for hardware independent packages. It does not cover the Board Support Package (BSP) and other hardware dependent system initialization. Mynewt defines several configuration parameters in the pkg.yml and syscfg.yml files. The newt tool uses this information to: Generate a system initialization function that calls all the package-specific system initialization functions. Generate a system configuration header file that contains all the package configuration settings and values. Display the system configuration settings and values in the newt target config command. The benefits with this approach include: Allows Mynewt developers to reuse other packages and easily change their configuration settings without updating source or header files when implementing new packages. Allows application developers to easily view the system configuration settings and values and determine the values to override for a target build. System Configuration Setting Definitions and Values A package can optionally: Define and expose the system configuration settings to allow other packages to override the default setting values. Override the system configuration setting values defined by the packages that it depends on. You use the defs parameter in a syscfg.yml file to define the system configuration settings for a package. defs is a mapping (or associative array) of system configuration setting definitions. It has the following syntax: syscfg.defs: PKGA_SYSCFG_NAME1: description: value: type: restrictions: PKGA_SYSCFG_NAME2: description: value: type: restrictions: Each setting definition consists of the following key-value mapping: A setting name for the key, such as PKGA_SYSCFG_NAME1 in the syntax example above. Note: A system configuration setting name must be unique. The newt tool aborts the build when multiple packages define the same setting. A mapping of fields for the value. Each field itself is a key-value pair of attributes. The field keys are description , value , type , and restrictions . They are described in following table: Field Description description Describes the usage for the setting. This field is optional. value Specifies the default value for the setting. This field is required. The value depends on the type that you specify and can be an empty string. type Specifies the data type for the value field. This field is optional. You can specify one of three types: raw - The value data is uninterpreted. This is the default type . task_priority - Specifies a Mynewt task priority number. The task priority number assigned to each setting must be unique and between 0 and 239. value can be one of the following: A number between 0 and 239 - The task priority number to use for the setting. any - Specify any to have newt automatically assign a priority for the setting. newt alphabetically orders all system configuration settings of this type and assigns the next highest available task priority number to each setting. flash_owner - Specifies a flash area. The value should be the name of a flash area defined in the BSP flash map for your target board. restrictions Specifies a list of restrictions on the setting value. This field is optional. You can specify two formats: $notnull - Specifies that the setting cannot have the empty string for a value. It essentially means that an empty string is not a sensible value and a package must override it with an appropriate value. expression - Specifies a boolean expression of the form [!]<required-setting>[if <base-value>] Examples: restrictions: !LOG_FCB - When this setting is enabled, LOG_FCB must be disabled. restrictions: LOG_FCB if 0 - When this setting is disabled, LOG_FCB must be enabled. Examples of Configuration Settings Example 1: The following example is an excerpt from the sys/log/full package syscfg.yml file. It defines the LOG_LEVEL configuration setting to specify the log level and the LOG_NEWTMGR configuration setting to specify whether to enable or disable the newtmgr logging feature. syscfg.defs: LOG_LEVEL: description: 'Log Level' value: 0 type: raw ... LOG_NEWTMGR: description: 'Enables or disables newtmgr command tool logging' value: 0 Example 2: The following example is an excerpt from the net/nimble/controller package syscfg.yml file. It defines the BLE_LL_PRIO configuration setting with a task_priority type and assigns task priority 0 to the BLE link layer task. syscfg.defs: BLE_LL_PRIO: description: 'BLE link layer task priority' type: 'task_priority' value: 0 Example 3: The following example is an excerpt from the fs/nffs package syscfg.yml file. syscfg.defs: NFFS_FLASH_AREA: description: 'The flash area to use for the Newtron Flash File System' type: flash_owner value: restrictions: - $notnull It defines the NFFS_FLASH_AREA configuration setting with a flash_owner type indicating that a flash area needs to be specified for the Newtron Flash File System. The flash areas are typically defined by the BSP in its bsp.yml file. For example, the bsp.yml for nrf52dk board ( hw/bsp/nrf52dk/bsp.yml ) defines an area named FLASH_AREA_NFFS : FLASH_AREA_NFFS: user_id: 1 device: 0 offset: 0x0007d000 size: 12kB The syscfg.yml file for the same board ( hw/bsp/nrf52dk/syscfg.yml ) specifies that the above area be used for NFFS_FLASH_AREA . syscfg.vals: CONFIG_FCB_FLASH_AREA: FLASH_AREA_NFFS REBOOT_LOG_FLASH_AREA: FLASH_AREA_REBOOT_LOG NFFS_FLASH_AREA: FLASH_AREA_NFFS COREDUMP_FLASH_AREA: FLASH_AREA_IMAGE_1 Note that the fs/nffs/syscfg.yml file indicates that the NFFS_FLASH_AREA setting cannot be a null string; so a higher priority package must set a non-null value to it. That is exactly what the BSP package does. For more on priority of packages in setting values, see the next section. Overriding System Configuration Setting Values A package may use the vals parameter in its syscfg.yml file to override the configuration values defined by other packages. This mechanism allows: Mynewt developers to implement a package and easily override the system configuration setting values that are defined by the packages it depends on. Application developers to easily and cleanly override default configuration settings in a single place and build a customized target. You can use the newt target config show <target-name> command to check all the system configuration setting definitions and values in your target to determine the setting values to override. See newt target . vals specifies the mappings of system configuration setting name-value pairs as follows: syscfg.vals: PKGA_SYSCFG_NAME1: VALUE1 PKGA_SYSCFG_NAME2: VALUE2 ... PKGN_SYSCFG_NAME1: VALUEN Note : The newt tool ignores overrides of undefined system configuration settings. Resolving Override Conflicts The newt tool uses package priorities to determine whether a package can override a value and resolve conflicts when multiple packages override the same system configuration setting. The following rules apply: A package can only override the default values of system configuration settings that are defined by lower priority packages. When packages with different priorities override the same system configuration setting value, newt uses the value from the highest priority package. Packages of equal priority cannot override the same system configuration setting with different values. newt aborts the build unless a higher priority package also overrides the value. The following package types are listed from highest to lowest priority: Target App unittest - A target can include either an app or unit test package, but not both. BSP Lib - Includes all other system level packages such as os, lib, sdk, and compiler. (Note that a Lib package cannot override other Lib package settings.) It is recommended that you override defaults at the target level instead of updating individual package syscfg.yml files. Examples of Overrides Example 4: The following example is an excerpt from the apps/slinky package syscfg.yml file. The application package overrides, in addition to other packages, the sys/log/full package system configuration settings defined in Example 1 . It changes the LOG_NEWTMGR system configuration setting value from 0 to 1 . syscfg.vals: # Enable the shell task. SHELL_TASK: 1 ... # Enable newtmgr commands. STATS_NEWTMGR: 1 LOG_NEWTMGR: 1 Example 5: The following example are excerpts from the hw/bsp/native package bsp.yml and syscfg.yml files. The package defines the flash areas for the BSP flash map in the bsp.yml file, and sets the NFFS_FLASH_AREA configuration setting value to use the flash area named FLASH_AREA_NFFS in the syscfg.yml file. bsp.flash_map: areas: # System areas. FLASH_AREA_BOOTLOADER: device: 0 offset: 0x00000000 size: 16kB ... # User areas. FLASH_AREA_REBOOT_LOG: user_id: 0 device: 0 offset: 0x00004000 size: 16kB FLASH_AREA_NFFS: user_id: 1 device: 0 offset: 0x00008000 size: 32kB syscfg.vals: NFFS_FLASH_AREA: FLASH_AREA_NFFS Generated syscfg.h and Referencing System Configuration Settings The newt tool processes all the package syscfg.yml files and generates the <target-path>/generated/include/syscfg/syscfg.h include file with #define statements for each system configuration setting defined. Newt creates a #define for a setting name as follows: Adds the prefix MYNEWT_VAL_ . Replaces all occurrences of \"/\", \"-\", and \" \" in the setting name with \"_\". Converts all characters to upper case. For example, the #define for my-config-name setting name is MYNEWT_VAL_MY_CONFIG_NAME. Newt groups the settings in syscfg.h by the packages that defined them. It also indicates the package that changed a system configuration setting value. You must use the MYNEWT_VAL() macro to reference a #define of a setting name in your header and source files. For example, to reference the my-config-name setting name, you use MYNEWT_VAL(MY_CONFIG_NAME) . Note: You only need to include syscfg/syscfg.h in your source files to access the syscfg.h file. The newt tool sets the correct include path to build your target. Example of syscfg.h and How to Reference a Setting Name Example 6 : The following example are excerpts from a sample syscfg.h file generated for an app/slinky target and from the sys/log/full package log.c file that shows how to reference a setting name. The syscfg.h file shows the sys/log/full package definitions and also indicates that app/slinky changed the value for the LOG_NEWTMGR settings. /** * This file was generated by Apache Newt (incubating) version: 1.0.0-dev */ #ifndef H_MYNEWT_SYSCFG_ #define H_MYNEWT_SYSCFG_ /** * This macro exists to ensure code includes this header when needed.

It checks the LOG_NEWTMGR setting value, using MYNEWT_VAL(LOG_NEWTMGR) , to determine whether the target application has enabled the newtmgr log functionality. It only registers the the callbacks to process the newtmgr log commands when the setting value is non-zero. void log_init(void) { int rc; /* Ensure this function only gets called by sysinit. */ SYSINIT_ASSERT_ACTIVE(); (void)rc; if (log_inited) { return; } log_inited = 1; ... #if MYNEWT_VAL(LOG_NEWTMGR) rc = log_nmgr_register_group(); SYSINIT_PANIC_ASSERT(rc == 0); #endif } System Initialization During system startup, Mynewt creates a default event queue and a main task to process events from this queue. You can override the OS_MAIN_TASK_PRIO and OS_MAIN_TASK_STACK_SIZE setting values defined by the kernel/os package to specify different task priority and stack size values. Your application's main() function executes in the context of the main task and must perform the following: At the start of main() , call the Mynewt sysinit() function to initialize the packages before performing any other processing. At the end of main() , wait for and dispatch events from the default event queue in an infinite loop. Note: You must include the sysinit/sysinit.h header file to access the sysinit() function. Here is an example of a main() function: int main(int argc, char **argv) { /* First, call sysinit() to perform the system and package initialization */ sysinit(); ... other application initialization processing.... /* Last, process events from the default event queue. */ while (1) { os_eventq_run(os_eventq_dflt_get()); } /* main never returns */ } Specifying Package Initialization Functions The sysinit() function calls the sysinit_app() function to perform system initialization for the packages in the target. You can, optionally, specify one or more package initialization functions that sysinit_app() calls to initialize a package. A package initialization function must have the following prototype: void init_func_name(void) Package initialization functions are called in stages to ensure that lower priority packages are initialized before higher priority packages. A stage is an integer value, 0 or higher, that specifies when an initialization function is called. Mynewt calls the package initialization functions in increasing stage number order. The call order for initialization functions with the same stage number depends on the order the packages are processed, and you cannot rely on a specific call order for these functions. You use the pkg.init parameter in the pkg.yml file to specify an initialization function and the stage number to call the function. You can specify multiple initialization functions, with a different stage number for each function, for the parameter values. This feature allows packages with interdependencies to perform initialization in multiple stages. The pkg.init parameter has the following syntax in the pkg.yml file: pkg.init: pkg_init_func1_name: pkg_init_func1_stage pkg_init_func2_name: pkg_init_func2_stage ... pkg_init_funcN_name: pkg_init_funcN_stage where pkg_init_func#_name is the C function name of an initialization function, and pkg_init_func#_stage is an integer value, 0 or higher, that indicates the stage when the pkg_init_func#_name function is called. Note: The pkg.init_function and pkg.init_stage parameters introduced in a previous release for specifying a package initialization function and a stage number are deprecated and have been retained to support the legacy format. They will not be maintained for future releases and we recommend that you migrate to use the pkg.init parameter. Generated sysinit_app() Function The newt tool processes the pkg.init parameters in all the pkg.yml files for a target, generates the sysinit_app() function in the <target-path>/generated/src/<target-name>-sysinit_app.c file, and includes the file in the build. Here is an example sysinit_app() function: ** * This file was generated by Apache Newt (incubating) version: 1.0.0-dev */ #if !SPLIT_LOADER void split_app_init(void); void os_pkg_init(void); void imgmgr_module_init(void); ... void stats_module_init(void); void sysinit_app(void) { /*** Stage 0 */ /* 0.0: kernel/os */ os_pkg_init(); /*** Stage 2 */ /* 2.0: sys/flash_map */ flash_map_init(); /*** Stage 10 */ /* 10.0: sys/stats/full */ stats_module_init(); /*** Stage 20 */ /* 20.0: sys/console/full */ console_pkg_init(); /*** Stage 100 */ /* 100.0: sys/log/full */ log_init(); /* 100.1: sys/mfg */ mfg_init(); .... /*** Stage 300 */ /* 300.0: sys/config */ config_pkg_init(); /*** Stage 500 */ /* 500.0: sys/id */ id_init(); /* 500.1: sys/shell */ shell_init(); ... /* 500.4: mgmt/imgmgr */ imgmgr_module_init(); /*** Stage 501 */ /* 501.0: mgmt/newtmgr/transport/nmgr_shell */ nmgr_shell_pkg_init(); } #endif Conditional Configurations You can use the system configuration setting values to conditionally specify parameter values in pkg.yml and syscfg.yml files. The syntax is: parameter_name.PKGA_SYSCFG_NAME: parameter_value This specifies that parameter_value is only set for parameter_name if the PKGA_SYSCFG_NAME configuration setting value is non-zero. Here is an example from the libs/os package pkg.yml file: pkg.deps: - sys/sysinit - util/mem pkg.deps.OS_CLI - sys/shell This example specifies that the os package depends on the sysinit and mem packages, and also depends on the shell package when OS_CLI is enabled.

This field is required. The value depends on the type that you specify and can be an empty string. type Specifies the data type for the value field. This field is optional. You can specify one of three types: raw - The value data is uninterpreted. This is the default type . task_priority - Specifies a Mynewt task priority number. The task priority number assigned to each setting must be unique and between 0 and 239. value can be one of the following: A number between 0 and 239 - The task priority number to use for the setting. any - Specify any to have newt automatically assign a priority for the setting. newt alphabetically orders all system configuration settings of this type and assigns the next highest available task priority number to each setting. flash_owner - Specifies a flash area. The value should be the name of a flash area defined in the BSP flash map for your target board. restrictions Specifies a list of restrictions on the setting value. This field is optional. You can specify two formats: $notnull - Specifies that the setting cannot have the empty string for a value. It essentially means that an empty string is not a sensible value and a package must override it with an appropriate value. expression - Specifies a boolean expression of the form [!]<required-setting>[if <base-value>] Examples: restrictions: !LOG_FCB - When this setting is enabled, LOG_FCB must be disabled. restrictions: LOG_FCB if 0 - When this setting is disabled, LOG_FCB must be enabled.","title":"System Configuration Setting Definitions and Values"},{"location":"os/modules/sysinitconfig/sysinitconfig/#examples-of-configuration-settings","text":"Example 1: The following example is an excerpt from the sys/log/full package syscfg.yml file.

A stage is an integer value, 0 or higher, that specifies when an initialization function is called. Mynewt calls the package initialization functions in increasing stage number order. The call order for initialization functions with the same stage number depends on the order the packages are processed, and you cannot rely on a specific call order for these functions. You use the pkg.init parameter in the pkg.yml file to specify an initialization function and the stage number to call the function.

You would use it to build regression tests for your library. Description A package may optionally contain a set of test cases. Test cases are not normally compiled and linked when a package is built; they are only included when the \"test\" identity is specified. All of a package's test code goes in its src/test directory. For example, the nffs package's test code is located in the following directory: * fs/nffs/src/test/ This directory contains the source and header files that implement the nffs test code. The test code has access to all the header files in the following directories: * src * src/arch/<target-arch> * include * src/test * src/test/arch/<target-arch> * include directories of all package dependencies Package test code typically depends on the testutil package, described later in this document. Some test cases or test initialization code may be platform-specific. In such cases, the platform-specific function definitions are placed in arch subdirectories within the package test directory. While building the test code (i.e., when the test identity is specified), the newt tool defines the TEST macro. This macro is defined during compilation of all C source files in all projects and packages. Tests are structured according to the following hierarchy: [test] / \\ [suite] [suite] / \\ / \\ [case] [case] [case] [case] I.e., a test consists of test suites, and a test suite consists of test cases. The test code uses testutil to define test suites and test cases. Regression test can then be executed using 'newt target test' command, or by including a call to your test suite from project/test/src/test.c .

Some test cases or test initialization code may be platform-specific. In such cases, the platform-specific function definitions are placed in arch subdirectories within the package test directory. While building the test code (i.e., when the test identity is specified), the newt tool defines the TEST macro. This macro is defined during compilation of all C source files in all projects and packages. Tests are structured according to the following hierarchy: [test] / \\ [suite] [suite] / \\ / \\ [case] [case] [case] [case] I.e., a test consists of test suites, and a test suite consists of test cases. The test code uses testutil to define test suites and test cases. Regression test can then be executed using 'newt target test' command, or by including a call to your test suite from project/test/src/test.c .","title":"Description"},{"location":"os/modules/testutil/testutil/#example","text":"This Tutorial shows how to create a test suite for a Mynewt package.","title":"Example"},{"location":"os/modules/testutil/testutil/#data-structures","text":"struct tu_config { int tc_print_results; int tc_system_assert; tu_case_init_fn_t *tc_case_init_cb; void *tc_case_init_arg; tu_case_report_fn_t *tc_case_fail_cb; void *tc_case_fail_arg; tu_case_report_fn_t *tc_case_pass_cb; void *tc_case_pass_arg; tu_suite_init_fn_t *tc_suite_init_cb; void *tc_suite_init_arg; tu_restart_fn_t *tc_restart_cb; void *tc_restart_arg; }; extern struct tu_config tu_config; The global tu_config struct contains all the testutil package's settings.

This tutorial explains how to add the support to your application. This tutorial assumes that you have read the Device Management with Newt Manager guide and are familiar with the newtmgr and oicmgr frameworks and all the options that are available to customize your application. This tutorial shows you how to configure your application to: Use the newtmgr framework. Use serial transport to communicate with the newtmgr tool. Support all Newt Manager commands. See Other Configuration Options on how to customize your application. Prerequisites Ensure that you have met the following prerequisites before continuing with this tutorial: Have Internet connectivity to fetch remote Mynewt components. Have a cable to establish a serial USB connection between the board and the laptop. Install the newt tool and toolchains (See Basic Setup ). Install the newtmgr tool . Use an Existing Project We assume that you have worked through at least some of the other tutorials and have an existing project. In this example, we modify the ble_tiny project to enable Newt Manager support. We call our application myble . You can create the application using any name you choose. Modify Package Dependencies and Configurations Add the following packages to the pkg.deps parameter in your target or application pkg.yml file: pkg.deps: - mgmt/newtmgr - mgmt/newtmgr/transport/nmgr_shell - mgmt/imgmgr - sys/log/full - sys/stats/full - sys/config - test/crash_test - test/runtest Each package provides the following Newt Manager functionality: mgmt/newtmgr : Supports the newtmgr framework and the Newt Manager echo , taskstats mpstats , datetime , and reset commands. mgmt/newtmgr/transport/nmgr_shell : Supports serial transport. mgmt/imgmgr : Supports the newtmgr image command sys/log/full : Supports the newtmgr log command. sys/stats/full : Supports the newtmgr stat command. sys/config : Supports the newtmgr config command. test/crash_test : Supports the newtmgr crash command. test/runtest : Supports the newt run command. Add the following configuration setting values to the syscfg.vals parameter in the target or application syscfg.yml file: syscfg.vals: LOG_NEWTMGR: 1 STATS_NEWTMGR: 1 CONFIG_NEWTMGR: 1 CRASH_TEST_NEWTMGR: 1 RUNTEST_NEWTMGR: 1 SHELL_TASK: 1 The first five configuration settings enable support for the Newt Manager log , stat , config , crash , and run commands. The SHELL_TASK setting enables the shell for serial transport. Note that you may need to override additional configuration settings that are specific to each package to customize the package functionality. Modify the Source By default, the mgmt package uses the Mynewt default event queue to receive request events from the newtmgr tool. These events are processed in the context of the application main task. You can specify a different event queue for the package to use. If you choose to use a dedicated event queue, you must create a task to process events from this event queue. The mgmt package executes and handles newtmgr request events in the context of this task. The mgmt package exports the mgmt_evq_set() function that allows you to specify an event queue. This example uses the Mynewt default event queue and you do not need to modify your application source. If you choose to use a different event queue, see Events and Event Queues for details on how to initialize an event queue and create a task to process the events. You will also need to modify your main.c to add the call to the mgmt_evq_set() function as follows: Add the mgmt/mgmt.h header file: #include <mgmt/mgmt.h> Add the call to specify the event queue. In the main() function, scroll down to the while (1) loop and add the following statement above the loop: mgmt_evq_set(&my_eventq) where my_eventq is an event queue that you have initialized. Build the Targets Build the two targets as follows: $ newt build nrf52_boot <snip> App successfully built: ./bin/nrf52_boot/apps/boot/boot.elf $ newt build myble Compiling hci_common.c Compiling util.c Archiving nimble.a Compiling os.c <snip> Create the Application Image Generate a signed application image for the myble target. You can use any version number you choose. $ newt create-image myble 1.0.0 App image successfully generated: ./bin/makerbeacon/apps/bletiny/bletiny.img Build manifest: ./bin/makerbeacon/apps/bletiny/manifest.json Load the Image Ensure the USB connector is in place and the power LED on the board is lit. Turn the power switch on your board off, then back on to reset the board after loading the image. $ newt load nrf52_boot $ newt load myble Set Up a Connection Profile The newtmgr tool requires a connection profile in order to connect to your board. If you have not done so, follow the instructions for setting up your connection profile. Communicate with Your Application Once you have a connection profile set up, you can connect to your device with newtmgr -c myconn <command> to run commands in your application. Issue the echo command to ensure that your application is communicating with the newtmgr tool: # newtmgr -c myconn echo hello hello Test your application to ensure that it can process a Newt Manager command that is supported by a different package. Issue the stat command to see the BLE stats. newtmgr -c myconn stat ble_att Return Code = 0 Stats Name: ble_att prep_write_req_tx: 0 indicate_req_tx: 0 write_rsp_tx: 0 find_info_req_tx: 0 read_rsp_rx: 0 read_group_type_rsp_tx: 0 indicate_req_rx: 0 find_type_value_rsp_tx: 0 ... read_req_rx: 0 read_type_req_rx: 0 notify_req_tx: 0 mtu_rsp_tx: 0 find_type_value_req_rx: 0 read_blob_rsp_rx: 0 read_group_type_req_tx: 0 exec_write_req_tx: 0 Your application is now able to communicate with the newtmgr tool. Other Configuration Options This section explains how to customize your application to use other Newt Manager protocol options. Newtmgr Framework Transport Protocol Options The newtmgr framework currently supports BLE and serial transport protocols. To configure the transport protocols that are supported, modify the pkg.yml and syscfg.yml files as follows: Add the mgmt/newtmgr/transport/ble package to the pkg.deps parameter to enable BLE transport. Add the mgmt/newtmgr/transport/nmgr_shell package to the pkg.deps parameter, and add SHELL_TASK: 1 to the syscfg.vals parameter to enable serial transport when your application also uses the Shell . Add the mgmt/newtmgr/transport/nmgr_uart package to the pkg.deps parameter to enable serial transport over a UART port. You can use this package instead of the nmgr_shell package when your application does not use the Shell or you want to use a dedicated UART port to communicate with newtmgr. You can change the NMGR_UART and NMGR_URART_SPEED sysconfig values to specify a different port. Oicmgr Framework Options To use the oicmgr framework instead of the newtmgr framework, modify the pkg.yml and syscfg.yml files as follows: Add the mgmt/oicmgr package (instead of the mgmt/newtmgr and mgmt/newtmgr/transport packages as described previously) to the pkg.deps parameter. Add OC_SERVER: 1 to the syscfg.vals parameter. Oicmgr supports the IP, serial, and BLE transport protocols. To configure the transport protocols that are supported, set the configuration setting values in the syscfg.vals parameter as follows: Add OC_TRANSPORT_IP: 1 to enable IP transport. Add OC_TRANSPORT_GATT: 1 to enable BLE transport. Add OC_TRANSPORT_SERIAL: 1 and SHELL_TASK: 1 to enable serial transport. Customize the Newt Manager Commands that Your Application Supports We recommend that you only enable support for the Newt Manager commands that your application uses to reduce your application code size. To configure the commands that are supported, set the configuration setting values in the syscfg.vals parameter as follows: Add LOG_NEWTMGR: 1 to enable support for the newtmgr log command. Add STATS_NEWTMGR: 1 to enable support for the newtmgr stat command. Add CONFIG_NEWTMGR: 1 to enable support for the newtmgr config command. Add CRASH_TEST_NEWTMGR: 1 to enable support for the newtmgr crash command. Add RUNTEST_NEWTMGR: 1 to enable support for the newtmgr crash command. Notes: When you enable Newt Manager support, using either the newtmgr or oicmgr framework, your application automatically supports the Newt Manager echo , taskstats , mpstats , datetime , and reset commands. These commands cannot be configured individually. The mgmt/imgmgr package does not provide a configuration setting to enable or disable support for the newtmgr image command. Do not specify the package in the pkg.deps parameter if your device has limited flash memory and cannot support Over-The-Air (OTA) firmware upgrades.","title":"Enable Newt Manager in any app"},{"location":"os/tutorials/add_newtmgr/#enabling-newt-manager-in-your-application","text":"In order for your application to communicate with the newtmgr tool and process Newt Manager commands, you must enable Newt Manager device management and the support to process Newt Manager commands in your application.

Prerequisites Ensure that you have met the following prerequisites before continuing with this tutorial: Have Internet connectivity to fetch remote Mynewt components. Have a cable to establish a serial USB connection between the board and the laptop Install the newt tool and toolchains (See Basic Setup ). Install the Segger JLINK package to load your project on the board. Use an existing project Since all we're doing is adding the shell and console capability to a project, we assume that you have worked through at least some of the other tutorials, and have an existing project. For this example, we'll be modifying the ble_tiny project to enable the shell and console connectivity. We'll be calling our app myble as in that project as well. Feel free to use whatever project you'd like though. Modify the Dependencies and Configuration The first thing you'll need to add is a few new dependencies for your app. To add shell support to your app make sure the following pkg.deps are defined in your target's pkg.yml file: pkg.deps: - \"@apache-mynewt-core/sys/console/full\" - \"@apache-mynewt-core/sys/shell\" - \"@apache-mynewt-core/sys/sysinit\" This lets the newt system know that it needs to pull in the code for the console and the shell. Now we'll need to modify the settings for the app to turn on the shell, etc. by modifying the syscfg.yml file for your target. (Remember, these files are in the targets/ directory.) If there isn't a syscfg.yml file in your target's directory, you will need to create one. # Package: apps/bletiny syscfg.vals: # Enable the shell task.

Use the Power ON/OFF switch to reset the board after loading the image. $ newt load myble Set up Serial connection You'll need a Serial connection to see the output of your program. You can reference the Serial Port Setup Tutorial for more information on setting up your serial communications. Connecting with your app Once you have a connection set up, you can connect to your device as follows: On Mac OS and Linux platforms, you can run minicom -D /dev/tty.usbserial-<port> -b 115200 to connect to the console of your app. Note that on Linux, the format of the port name is /dev/ttyUSB<N> , where N is a number. On Windows, you can use a terminal application such as PuTTY to connect to the device. If you located your port from a MinGW terminal, the port name format is /dev/ttyS<N> , where N is a number. You must map the port name to a Windows COM port: /dev/ttyS<N> maps to COM<N+1> . For example, /dev/ttyS2 maps to COM3 . You can also use the Windows Device Manager to locate the COM port.

We'll need a task handler with an event queue for the CO 2 readings -- they were handled by the shell task in the previous tutorial but now it needs to be replaced by a different handler as shown below. /* CO2 Task settings */ #define CO2_TASK_PRIO 5 #define CO2_STACK_SIZE (OS_STACK_ALIGN(336)) struct os_eventq co2_evq ; struct os_task co2_task ; bssnz_t os_stack_t co2_stack [ CO2_STACK_SIZE ]; And of course we'll need to go to our main() and do all the standard task and event setup we normally do by adding the following. Again, remember to delete all the shell event queues and tasks. /* Initialize sensor eventq */ os_eventq_init ( &co2_evq ); /* Create the CO2 reader task. * All sensor reading operations are performed in this task. */ os_task_init ( &co2_task , \"sensor\" , co2_task_handler , NULL , CO2_TASK_PRIO , OS_WAIT_FOREVER , co2_stack , CO2_STACK_SIZE ); We'll also need to add a task handler -- since we initialized it above: /** * Event loop for the sensor task. */ static void co2_task_handler ( void *unused ) { while ( 1 ) { co2_read_event (); /* Wait 2 second */ os_time_delay ( OS_TICKS_PER_SEC * 2 ); } } And finally, we'll take care of that co2_read_event() function: int co2_read_event ( void ) { int value ; enum senseair_read_type type = SENSEAIR_CO2 ; uint16_t chr_val_handle ; int rc ; value = senseair_read ( type ); if ( value >= 0 ) { console_printf ( \"Got %d\\n\" , value ); } else { console_printf ( \"Error while reading: %d\\n\" , value ); goto err ; } gatt_co2_val = value ; rc = ble_gatts_find_chr ( &gatt_svr_svc_co2_uuid . u , BLE_UUID16_DECLARE ( CO2_SNS_VAL ), NULL , &chr_val_handle ); assert ( rc == 0 ); ble_gatts_chr_updated ( chr_val_handle ); return ( 0 ); err : return ( rc ); } You'll notice that it looks eeirily similar to a portion of the shell event we created earlier. This one simply reads and updates the CO 2 value and sends that over BLE to any connected clients instead. We can now build, create-image and load the app onto our Arduino Primo board, and then connect and see the updated values! The image below shows the results using MyNewt Sensor Reader, a Mac OS X app developed for connecting to MyNewt devices over Bluetooth but you can also use LightBlue or any other application that can connect to, and read, Bluetooth data.

We'll need a task handler with an event queue for the CO 2 readings -- they were handled by the shell task in the previous tutorial but now it needs to be replaced by a different handler as shown below. /* CO2 Task settings */ #define CO2_TASK_PRIO 5 #define CO2_STACK_SIZE (OS_STACK_ALIGN(336)) struct os_eventq co2_evq ; struct os_task co2_task ; bssnz_t os_stack_t co2_stack [ CO2_STACK_SIZE ]; And of course we'll need to go to our main() and do all the standard task and event setup we normally do by adding the following. Again, remember to delete all the shell event queues and tasks. /* Initialize sensor eventq */ os_eventq_init ( &co2_evq ); /* Create the CO2 reader task. * All sensor reading operations are performed in this task. */ os_task_init ( &co2_task , \"sensor\" , co2_task_handler , NULL , CO2_TASK_PRIO , OS_WAIT_FOREVER , co2_stack , CO2_STACK_SIZE ); We'll also need to add a task handler -- since we initialized it above: /** * Event loop for the sensor task. */ static void co2_task_handler ( void *unused ) { while ( 1 ) { co2_read_event (); /* Wait 2 second */ os_time_delay ( OS_TICKS_PER_SEC * 2 ); } } And finally, we'll take care of that co2_read_event() function: int co2_read_event ( void ) { int value ; enum senseair_read_type type = SENSEAIR_CO2 ; uint16_t chr_val_handle ; int rc ; value = senseair_read ( type ); if ( value >= 0 ) { console_printf ( \"Got %d\\n\" , value ); } else { console_printf ( \"Error while reading: %d\\n\" , value ); goto err ; } gatt_co2_val = value ; rc = ble_gatts_find_chr ( &gatt_svr_svc_co2_uuid . u , BLE_UUID16_DECLARE ( CO2_SNS_VAL ), NULL , &chr_val_handle ); assert ( rc == 0 ); ble_gatts_chr_updated ( chr_val_handle ); return ( 0 ); err : return ( rc ); } You'll notice that it looks eeirily similar to a portion of the shell event we created earlier. This one simply reads and updates the CO 2 value and sends that over BLE to any connected clients instead. We can now build, create-image and load the app onto our Arduino Primo board, and then connect and see the updated values! The image below shows the results using MyNewt Sensor Reader, a Mac OS X app developed for connecting to MyNewt devices over Bluetooth but you can also use LightBlue or any other application that can connect to, and read, Bluetooth data. Congratulations!!","title":"Add Bluetooth GATT Services"},{"location":"os/tutorials/air_quality_sensor/","text":"Air quality sensor project Setting up source tree for stuff you need To start with, you need to create a new project under which you will do this development. So you type in: $ mkdir $HOME/src $ cd $HOME/src $ newt new air_quality Let's say you are using Arduino Primo -- which is based on the Nordic Semi NRF52 chip -- as the platform. You know you need the board support package for that hardware. You can look up its location, add it your project, and fetch that along with the core OS components. Luckily, the Arduino Primo is supported in the Mynewt Core, so there's nothing much to do here. Your project.yml file should look like this: [user@IsMyLaptop:~/src/air_quality]$ emacs project.yml & [user@IsMyLaptop:~/src/air_quality]$ cat project.yml project.name: \"air_quality\" project.repositories: - apache-mynewt-core # Use github's distribution mechanism for core ASF libraries. # This provides mirroring automatically for us. # repository.apache-mynewt-core: type: github vers: 0-latest user: apache repo: incubator-mynewt-core [user@IsMyLaptop:~/src/air_quality]$ newt install apache-mynewt-core [user@IsMyLaptop:~/src/air_quality]$ ls repos/ apache-mynewt-core Good. You want to make sure you have all the needed bits for supporting your board; so you decide to build the blinky project for the platform first. Now create a target for it and build it. Easiest way to proceed is to copy the existing target for blinky, and modify it to build for Arduino Primo board. [user@IsMyLaptop:~/src/air_quality]$ newt target copy my_blinky_sim blink_primo Target successfully copied; targets/my_blinky_sim --> targets/blink_primo [user@IsMyLaptop:~/src/air_quality]$ newt target set blink_primo bsp=@apache-mynewt-core/hw/bsp/arduino_primo_nrf52 Target targets/blink_nrf successfully set target.bsp to @apache-mynewt-core/hw/bsp/arduino_primo_nrf52 [user@IsMyLaptop:~/src/air_quality]$ newt build blink_primo Compiling hal_bsp.c ... Linking blinky.elf App successfully built: /Users/user/src/air_quality/bin/blink_primo/apps/blinky/blinky.elf Good. You know that this platform uses bootloader, which means you have to create a target for that too. [user@IsMyLaptop:~/src/air_quality]$ newt target create boot_primo Target targets/boot_nrf successfully created [user@IsMyLaptop:~/src/air_quality]$ newt target show @apache-mynewt-core/targets/unittest bsp=hw/bsp/native build_profile=debug compiler=compiler/sim targets/blink_primo app=apps/blinky bsp=@apache-mynewt-core/hw/bsp/arduino_primo_nrf52 build_profile=debug targets/boot_primo targets/my_blinky_sim app=apps/blinky bsp=@apache-mynewt-core/hw/bsp/native build_profile=debug [user@IsMyLaptop:~/src/air_quality]$ newt target set boot_nrf bsp=@apache-mynewt-core/hw/bsp/arduino_primo_nrf52 Target targets/boot_nrf successfully set target.bsp to @apache-mynewt-core/hw/bsp/arduino_primo_nrf52 [user@IsMyLaptop:~/src/air_quality]$ newt target set boot_nrf app=@apache-mynewt-core/apps/boot Target targets/boot_nrf successfully set target.app to @apache-mynewt-core/apps/boot [user@IsMyLaptop:~/src/air_quality]$ newt target set boot_nrf build_profile=optimized Target targets/boot_nrf successfully set target.build_profile to optimized And then build it, and load it onto the board. newt build boot_primo .... Linking boot.elf App successfully built: /Users/user/src/air_quality/bin/boot_primo/apps/boot/boot.elf [user@IsMyLaptop:~/src/air_quality] $ newt load boot_primo At this point, you may (or may not) see a bunch of error messages about not being able to connect to your board, not being able to load the image, etc. If that's the case, and you haven't already, you should most definitely go worth through the blinky_primo tutorial so that you can properly communicate with your board. Next you must download the targets to board, and see that the LED actually blinks. You plug in the Arduino Primo board to your laptop, and say: [user@IsMyLaptop:~/src/air_quality]$ newt load blink_primo Loading app image into slot 1 Error: couldn't open /Users/user/src/air_quality/bin/blink_primo/apps/blinky/blinky.img Error: exit status 1 load - Load app image to target for <target-name>.

Forgot to create an image out of the blinky binary. Note that every time you want to build and load a new firmware image to a target board, you need to run 'create-image' on it. [user@IsMyLaptop:~/src/air_quality]$ newt create-image blink_primo 0.0.1 App image successfully generated: /Users/user/src/air_quality/bin/blink_primo/apps/blinky/blinky.img Build manifest: /Users/user/src/air_quality/bin/blink_nrf/apps/blinky/manifest.json [user@IsMyLaptop:~/src/air_quality]$ newt load blink_primo And it's blinking. Shortcut for doing build/create-image/load/debug steps all in one is 'newt run' command. Check out the usage from command line help. Create test project Now that you have your system setup, you can start creating your own stuff. First you want to create a project for yourself - you could start by using blinky as a project template, but since we're going to want to be able to access the data via Bluetooth, let's use the bleprph Bluetooth Peripheral project instead. [user@IsMyLaptop:~/src/air_quality]$ mkdir apps/air_quality [user@IsMyLaptop:~/src/air_quality]$ cp repos/apache-mynewt-core/apps/bleprph/pkg.yml apps/air_quality/ [user@IsMyLaptop:~/src/air_quality]$ cp -Rp repos/apache-mynewt-core/apps/bleprph/src apps/air_quality/ Then you modify the apps/air_quality/pkg.yml for air_quality in order to change the pkg.name to be apps/air_quality . You'll need to add the @apache-mynewt-core/ path to all the package dependencies, since the app no longer resides within the apache-mynewt-core repository.

To start development of the driver, you first need to create a package description for it, and add stubs for sources. The first thing to do is to create the directory structure for your driver: [user@IsMyLaptop:~/src/air_quality]$ mkdir -p libs/my_drivers/senseair/include/senseair [user@IsMyLaptop:~/src/air_quality]$ mkdir -p libs/my_drivers/senseair/src Now you can add the files you need. You'll need a pkg.yml to describe the driver, and then header stub followed by source stub.

Add CLI commands for testing drivers While developing the driver, you want to issue operations from console asking it to do stuff. We'll assume that you've already worked through the tutorial on how to enable the CLI , so all we'll need to do is add the propper values to the project's syscfg.yml file: [user@IsMyLaptop:~/src/air_quality]$ cat targets/air_q/syscfg.yml syscfg.vals: # Set as per blinky_primo OPENOCD_DEBUG: 1 # Enable the shell task.

If you haven't already, familiarize yourself with the tutorial on how to connect a serial port to your board here . You'll need to wire up your Board to a Serial converter first. On the Arduino Primo Board pin 1 is TX and pin 0 is RX so wire 1 to RX on your serial board, and 0 to TX on your serial board.

Your shell task is running, and is responding appropriately! You can connect the hardware to your board and start developing code for the driver itself. Use of HAL for drivers The sensor has a serial port connection, and that's how you are going to connect to it. Your original BSP, hw/bsp/arduino_primo_nrf52, has two UARTs set up. We're using one for our shell/console. It also has a second UART set up as a 'bit-bang' UART but since the SenseAir only needs to communicate at 9600 baud, this bit-banged uart is plenty fast enough. You'll have to make a small change to the syscfg.yml file in your project's target directory to change the pin definitions for this second UART. Those changes are as follows: UART_0_PIN_TX: 23 UART_0_PIN_RX: 24 With this in place, you can refer to serial port where your SenseAir sensor by a logical number. This makes the code more platform independent - you could connect this sensor to another board, like Olimex. You will also use the HAL UART abstraction to do the UART port setup and data transfer. That way you don't need to have any platform dependent pieces within your little driver. You will now see what the driver code ends up looking like.

Now comes the fun part: Hooking up the sensor! It's fun because a) hooking up a sensor is always fun and b) the SenseAir sensor's PCB is entirely unlabeled, so you'll have to trust us on how to hook it up. So here we go. You'll have to do a little soldering. I soldered some header pins to the SenseAir K30 board to make connecting wires easier using standard jumper wires, but you can also just solder wires straight to the board if you prefer. Here's what your SenseAir board should look like once it's wired up: Now that you have that wired up, let's get the Arduino Primo wired up. A couple of things to note: The Arduino Primo's 'console' UART is actually UART1. The secondary (bit-banged) UART is UART0, so that's where we'll have to hook up the SenseAir. Here's what your Arduino Primo should now look like with everything wired in: Everything is wired and you're ready to go!

You know you need the board support package for that hardware. You can look up its location, add it your project, and fetch that along with the core OS components. Luckily, the Arduino Primo is supported in the Mynewt Core, so there's nothing much to do here. Your project.yml file should look like this: [user@IsMyLaptop:~/src/air_quality]$ emacs project.yml & [user@IsMyLaptop:~/src/air_quality]$ cat project.yml project.name: \"air_quality\" project.repositories: - apache-mynewt-core # Use github's distribution mechanism for core ASF libraries. # This provides mirroring automatically for us. # repository.apache-mynewt-core: type: github vers: 0-latest user: apache repo: incubator-mynewt-core [user@IsMyLaptop:~/src/air_quality]$ newt install apache-mynewt-core [user@IsMyLaptop:~/src/air_quality]$ ls repos/ apache-mynewt-core Good. You want to make sure you have all the needed bits for supporting your board; so you decide to build the blinky project for the platform first. Now create a target for it and build it. Easiest way to proceed is to copy the existing target for blinky, and modify it to build for Arduino Primo board.

Next you must download the targets to board, and see that the LED actually blinks.

Now comes the fun part: Hooking up the sensor! It's fun because a) hooking up a sensor is always fun and b) the SenseAir sensor's PCB is entirely unlabeled, so you'll have to trust us on how to hook it up. So here we go. You'll have to do a little soldering. I soldered some header pins to the SenseAir K30 board to make connecting wires easier using standard jumper wires, but you can also just solder wires straight to the board if you prefer. Here's what your SenseAir board should look like once it's wired up: Now that you have that wired up, let's get the Arduino Primo wired up. A couple of things to note: The Arduino Primo's 'console' UART is actually UART1. The secondary (bit-banged) UART is UART0, so that's where we'll have to hook up the SenseAir. Here's what your Arduino Primo should now look like with everything wired in: Everything is wired and you're ready to go!

Prerequisites Meet the prerequisites listed in Project Blinky . Have an Arduino Zero board. Note: There are many flavors of Arduino. Make sure you are using an Arduino Zero. See below for the versions of Arduino Zero that are compatible with this tutorial. Install the OpenOCD debugger . This tutorial uses the Arduino Zero Pro board. The tutorial has been tested on the following three Arduino Zero boards - Zero, M0 Pro, and Zero-Pro. Mynewt has not been tested on Arduino M0 which has no internal debugger support. Create a Project Create a new project if you do not have an existing one. You can skip this step and proceed to fetch external packages if you already created a project. Run the following commands to create a new project: $ mkdir ~/dev $ cd ~/dev $ newt new myproj Downloading project skeleton from apache/incubator-mynewt-blinky... Installing skeleton in myproj... Project myproj successfully created. $ cd myproj $ newt install apache-mynewt-core $ Fetch External Packages Mynewt uses source code provided directly from the chip manufacturer for low level operations. Sometimes this code is licensed only for the specific manufacturer of the chipset and cannot live in the Apache Mynewt repository. That happens to be the case for the Arduino Zero board which uses Atmel SAMD21. Runtime's github repository hosts such external third-party packages and the newt tool can fetch them. To fetch the package with MCU support for Atmel SAMD21 for Arduino Zero from the Runtime git repository, you need to add the repository to the project.yml file in your base project directory. Here is an example project.yml file with the Arduino Zero repository added. The sections with mynewt_arduino_zero that need to be added to your project file are highlighted. Note: On Windows platforms: You need to set vers to 0-dev and use the latest master branch for both repositories. $ more project.yml project.name: \"my_project\" project.repositories: - apache-mynewt-core - mynewt_arduino_zero repository.apache-mynewt-core: type: github vers: 1-latest user: apache repo: incubator-mynewt-core repository.mynewt_arduino_zero: type: github vers: 1-latest user: runtimeco repo: mynewt_arduino_zero $ Install the project dependencies using the newt install command (you can specify -v for verbose output): $ newt install apache-mynewt-core mynewt_arduino_zero $ NOTE: If there has been a new release of a repo used in your project since you last installed it, the 1-latest version for the repo in the project.yml file will refer to the new release and will not match the installed files. In that case you will get an error message saying so and you will need to run newt upgrade to overwrite the existing files with the latest codebase. You need to create two targets for the Arduino Zero Pro board, one for the bootloader and one for the Blinky application. Run the following newt target commands, from your project directory, to create a bootloader target. We name the target arduino_boot . $ newt target create arduino_boot $ newt target set arduino_boot bsp=@mynewt_arduino_zero/hw/bsp/arduino_zero Target targets/arduino_boot successfully created $ newt target set arduino_boot app=@apache-mynewt-core/apps/boot Target targets/arduino_boot successfully set target.app to @apache-mynewt-core/apps/boot $ newt target set arduino_boot build_profile=optimized Target targets/arduino_boot successfully set target.build_profile to optimized $ newt target set arduino_boot syscfg=BSP_ARDUINO_ZERO_PRO=1 Target targets/arduino_boot successfully set target.syscfg to BSP_ARDUINO_ZERO_PRO=1 $ Note: If you have an Arduino Zero instead of an Arduino Zero Pro or Arduino M0 Pro board, replace BSP_ARDUINO_ZERO_PRO with BSP_ARDUINO_ZERO in the last newt target set command. These commands perform the following: Create a target named arduino_boot for the Arduino Zero Bootloader. Set the application for the arduino_boot target to the default Apache Mynewt bootloader ( @apache-mynewt-core/apps/boot ) Set the board support package for the target to @mynewt_arduino_zero/hw/bsp/arduino_zero . This is a reference to the downloaded Arduino Zero support from Github. Use the \"optimized\" build profile for the arduino_boot target. This instructs Newt to generate smaller and more efficient code for this target. This setting is necessary due to the bootloader's strict size constraints. Sets the system configuration setting for Board Support Package to support the Arduino Zero Pro. See the Concepts section for more information on setting options. Create a Target for the Blinky Application Run the following newt target commands to create the Blinky application target. We name the application target arduino_blinky . $ newt target create arduino_blinky Target targets/arduino_blinky successfully created $ newt target set arduino_blinky app=apps/blinky Target targets/arduino_blinky successfully set target.app to apps/blinky $ newt target set arduino_blinky bsp=@mynewt_arduino_zero/hw/bsp/arduino_zero Target targets/arduino_blinky successfully set target.bsp to @mynewt_arduino_zero/hw/bsp/arduino_zero $ newt target set arduino_blinky build_profile=debug Target targets/arduino_blinky successfully set target.build_profile to debug $ newt target set arduino_blinky syscfg=BSP_ARDUINO_ZERO_PRO=1 Target targets/arduino_boot successfully set target.syscfg to BSP_ARDUINO_ZERO_PRO=1 $ Note: If you have an Arduino Zero instead of a Arduino Zero Pro board, replace BSP_ARDUINO_ZERO_PRO with BSP_ARDUINO_ZERO in the last newt target set command.

Mynewt will load the image onto the board and debug the target through this port. You should see a green LED come on that indicates the board has power. No external debugger is required. The Arduino Zero comes with an internal debugger that can be accessed by Mynewt. The images below show the Arduino Zero Programming Port. Load the Bootloader onto the Board Run the newt load arduino_boot command to load the bootloader onto the board: $ newt load arduino_boot Loading bootloader $ The bootloader is loaded onto your board succesfully when the newt load command returns to the command prompt after the Loading bootloader status message. You can proceed to load and run your Blinky application image (See Run the Blinky Application ). If the newt load command outputs the following error messages, you will need to erase the board. $ newt load arduino_boot -v Loading bootloader Error: Downloading ~/dev/myproj/bin/targets/arduino_boot/app/apps/boot/boot.elf.bin to 0x0 Open On-Chip Debugger 0.9.0 (2015-11-15-05:39) Licensed under GNU GPL v2 For bug reports, read http://openocd.org/doc/doxygen/bugs.html Info : only one transport option; autoselect 'swd' adapter speed: 500 kHz adapter_nsrst_delay: 100 cortex_m reset_config sysresetreq Info : CMSIS-DAP: SWD Supported Info : CMSIS-DAP: JTAG Supported Info : CMSIS-DAP: Interface Initialised (SWD) Info : CMSIS-DAP: FW Version = 01.1F.0118 Info : SWCLK/TCK = 1 SWDIO/TMS = 1 TDI = 1 TDO = 1 nTRST = 0 nRESET = 1 Info : CMSIS-DAP: Interface ready Info : clock speed 500 kHz Info : SWD IDCODE 0x0bc11477 Info : at91samd21g18.cpu: hardware has 4 breakpoints, 2 watchpoints Error: Target not halted To erase your board, start a debug session and enter the highlighted commands at the (gdb) prompts: Note: On Windows, openocd and gdb are started in separate Windows Command Prompt terminals, and the terminals are automatically closed when you quit gdb.

Reminder if you are using Docker: When working with actual hardware, remember that each board has an ID. If you swap boards and do not refresh the USB Device Filter on the VirtualBox UI, the ID might be stale and the Docker instance may not be able to see the board correctly. For example, you may see an error message like Error: unable to find CMSIS-DAP device when you try to load or run an image on the board. In that case, you need to click on the USB link in VirtualBox UI, remove the existing USB Device Filter (e.g. \"Atmel Corp. EDBG CMSIS-DAP[0101]\") by clicking on the \"Removes selected USB filter\" button, and add a new filter by clicking on the \"Adds new USB filter\" button. Run the Blinky Application After you load the bootloader successfully onto your board, you can load and run the Blinky application. Run the newt run arduino_blinky 1.0.0 command to build the arduino_blinky target (if necessary), create an image with version 1.0.0, load the image onto the board, and start a debugger session. Note The output of the debug session below is for Mac OS and Linux platforms. On Windows, openocd and gdb are started in separate Windows Command Prompt terminals.

You may build the Mynewt image using a laptop running any OS of your choice - Mac, Linux, or Windows. The host used in this specific example is the BlueZ Bluetooth stack. Since BlueZ is a Bluetooth stack for Linux kernel-based family of operating system, the tutorial expects a computer running Linux OS and with BlueZ installed to talk to the board with the Mynewt image. Prerequisites Ensure that you meet the following prerequisites before continuing with one of the tutorials. Have Internet connectivity to fetch remote Mynewt components. Have a board with BLE radio that is supported by Mynewt. We will use an nRF52 Dev board in this tutorial. Have a USB TTL Serial Cable that supports hardware flow control such as ones found at http://www.ftdichip.com/Products/Cables/USBTTLSerial.htm to establish a serial USB connection between the board and the laptop. Install the newt tool and toolchains (See Basic Setup ). Install a BLE host such as BlueZ on a Linux machine to talk to the nrf52 board running Mynewt.

Once you have a connection set up, you can connect to your device as follows: On Mac OS and Linux platforms, you can run minicom -D /dev/tty.usbserial-<port> -b 115200 to connect to the console of your app. Note that on Linux, the format of the port name is /dev/ttyUSB<N> , where N is a number. On Windows, you can run PuTTY to connect to the device. If you located your port from a MinGW terminal, the port name format is /dev/ttyS<N> , where N is a number. You must map the port name to a Windows COM port: /dev/ttyS<N> maps to COM<N+1> . For example, /dev/ttyS2 maps to COM3 . You can also use the Windows Device Manager to locate the COM port number.

Prerequisites Work through one of the Blinky Tutorials to create and build a Blinky application for one of the boards. Have a serial setup . Use an Existing Project Since all we're doing is adding the shell and console capability to blinky, we assume that you have worked through at least some of the other tutorials, and have an existing project. For this example, we'll be modifying the blinky on nrf52 project to enable the shell and console connectivity. You can use blinky on a different board. Modify the Dependencies and Configuration Add the following dependencies to your application target's pkg.yml file: pkg.deps: - \"@apache-mynewt-core/sys/console/full\" - \"@apache-mynewt-core/sys/shell\" - \"@apache-mynewt-core/sys/sysinit\" This lets the newt system know that it needs to pull in the code for the console and the shell. Modify the system configuration settings to enable Shell and Console ticks and prompt. Add the following to your application target's syscfg.yml file: syscfg.vals: # Enable the shell task. SHELL_TASK: 1 # Enable Console OS Ticks CONSOLE_TICKS: 1 # Enable Console Prompt CONSOLE_PROMPT: 1 Use the OS Default Event Queue to Process Blinky Timer and Shell Events Mynewt creates a main task that executes the application main() function. It also creates an OS default event queue that packages can use to queue their events. Shell uses the OS default event queue for Shell events, and main() can process the events in the context of the main task. Blinky's main.c is very simple. It only has a main() function that executes an infinite loop to toggle the LED and sleep for one second.

Run the newt load nrf52_blinky command to load the Blinky application image onto the board. $ newt load nrf52_blinky Loading app image into slot 1 Set Up a Serial Connection You'll need a Serial connection to see the output of your program. You can reference the Serial Port Setup Tutorial for more information on setting up your serial communication. Communicate with the Application Once you have a connection set up, you can connect to your device as follows: On Mac OS and Linux platforms, you can run minicom -D /dev/tty.usbserial-<port> -b 115200 to connect to the console of your app. Note that on Linux, the format of the port name is /dev/ttyUSB<N> , where N is a number. On Windows, you can use a terminal application such as PuTTY to connect to the device. If you located your port from a MinGW terminal, the port name format is /dev/ttyS<N> , where N is a number. You must map the port name to a Windows COM port: /dev/ttyS<N> maps to COM<N+1> . For example, /dev/ttyS2 maps to COM3 . You can also use the Windows Device Manager to locate the COM port.

It is assumed you have already installed newt tool. It is assumed you already installed native tools as described here Also, we assume that you're familiar with UNIX shells. Let's gets started! Prepare the Software Make sure the PATH environment variable includes the $HOME/dev/go/bin directory. Create a project Create a new project to hold your work. For a deeper understanding, you can read about project creation in Get Started -- Creating Your First Project or just follow the commands below. $ mkdir ~/dev $ cd ~/dev $ newt new myproj Downloading project skeleton from apache/incubator-mynewt-blinky...

Starting with the target name, assign specific aspects of the project, as shown below, to pull the appropriate packages and build the right bundle or list for the board. For example, we set the build_profile, board support package (bsp), and app. $ newt target create blinky $ newt target set blinky build_profile=debug $ newt target set blinky bsp=@apache-mynewt-core/hw/bsp/olimex_stm32-e407_devboard $ newt target set blinky app=apps/blinky $ newt target show blinky targets/blinky app=apps/blinky bsp=hw/bsp/olimex_stm32-e407_devboard build_profile=debug Build the image Next, let's build the image for the above target. By default, the linker script within the hw/bsp/olimex_stm32-e407_devboard package builds an image for flash memory, which we don't want; instead, we want an image for the SRAM, so you need to switch that script with run_from_sram.ld . Afer you build the target, you can find the executable blinky.elf in the project directory ~/dev/myproj/bin/blinky/apps/blinky/. $ cd ~/dev/myproj/repos/apache-mynewt-core/hw/bsp/olimex_stm32-e407_devboard/ $ diff olimex_stm32-e407_devboard.ld run_from_sram.ld (some diff will be displayed) $ cp run_from_sram.ld olimex_stm32-e407_devboard.ld $ cd ~/dev/myproj $ newt build blinky Compiling case.c Compiling suite.c ...

B1_1/B1_0 and B0_1/B0_0 are PTH jumpers. Note that because the markings on the board may not always be accurate, when in doubt, you should always refer to the manual for the correct positioning. Since the jumpers are a pair, they should move together, and as such, the pair is responsible for the boot mode when bootloader is present. To locate the bootloader, the board searches in three places: User Flash Memory, System Memory or the Embedded SRAM. For this Blinky project, we will configure it to boot from SRAM by jumpering B0_1 and B1_1 . Connect USB-OTG#2 in the picture above to a USB port on your computer (or a powered USB hub to make sure there is enough power available to the board). The red PWR LED should be lit. Connect the JTAG connector to the SWD/JTAG interface on the board. The other end of the cable should be connected to the USB port or hub of your computer. Let's Go! Ensure that you are in the blinky project directory with the blinky.elf executable. Run the debug command in the newt tool. You'll see some status messages as shown below. In case you need to halt the debugging session, you can issue an -c \"reset halt\" command. $ newt debug blinky Debugging with ~/dev/core/hw/bsp/olimex_...

You can run the newt tool natively on a computer running any of the three Operating System machines - OSX, Linux, or Windows. However, Mynewt OS images for a simulated target are built on the Windows machine by using Linux versions of the build software (newt)in a virtual machine on your Windows box. The Linux VM is set up by installing the Docker Toolbox. Your Windows machine will communicate with the Linux VM via transient ssh connections. You will then download a Docker image ( newtvm.exe )that allows you to run the newt commands in the Linux Docker instance. The Docker image contains: The newt command-line tool Go A multilib-capable native gcc / glibc An arm-none-eabi gcc Native gdb The sequence of events when using the Docker image is as follows: A new docker environment is created in the Linux VM. The specified command with the newtvm prefix ( newtvm newt command) is sent to the docker environment via ssh. The Linux command runs. The output from the command is sent back to Windows via ssh. The output is displayed in the Windows command prompt. Install Linux virtual machine Download the Docker Toolbox for Windows (version 1.9.0c or later) from https://www.docker.com/docker-toolbox . The Docker toolbox creates a consistently reproducible and self-contained environment in Linux. Run the Docker Toolbox installer. All the default settings are OK.

Getting your Windows machine ready for hardware target When you want to produce images for actual hardware board on your Windows machine, go through the following setup procedure and then proceed to the blinky project on the Olimex board with this method. Installing some prerequisites You have to install the following if you do not have them already. The steps below indicate specific folders where each of these programs should be installed. You can choose different locations, but the remainder of this tutorial for a Windows machine assumes the specified folders. win-builds-i686 win-builds-x86_64 MSYS gcc for ARM openocd zadig git go win-builds (mingw64) 1.5 for i686 Download from http://win-builds.org/doku.php/download_and_installation_from_windows .

Specify the \"Use Git from the Windows Command Prompt\" option. The defaults for all other options are OK. Go Download the release for Microsoft Windows from https://golang.org/dl/ and install it \"C:\\Go\". Creating local repository The directory structure must be first readied for using Go. Go code must be kept inside a workspace. A workspace is a directory hierarchy with three directories at its root: src contains Go source files organized into packages (one package per directory), pkg contains package objects, and bin contains executable commands. The GOPATH environment variable specifies the location of your workspace. First create a 'dev' directory and then a 'go' directory under it. Set the GOPATH environment variable to this directory and then proceed to create the directory for cloning the newt tool repository. $ cd c :\\ $ mkdir dev\\go $ cd dev\\go Set the following user environment variables using the steps outlined here. * GOPATH : C : \\dev\\go * PATH : C : \\Program Files ( x86 ) \\GNU Tools ARM Embedded\\ 4.9 2015 q3\\bin ; %GOPATH%\\bin ; C : \\win-builds-x86_64\\bin ; C : \\win-builds-i686\\bin ; C : \\msys\\bin Steps: Right-click the start button Click \"Control panel\" Click \"System and Security\" Click \"System\" Click \"Advanced system settings\" in the left panel Click the \"Envoronment Variables...\" button There will be two sets of environment variables: user variables in the upper half of the screen, and system variables in the lower half. Configuring the user variables is recommended and tested (though system variables will work as well). Next, install godep. Note that the following command produces no output. $ go get github . com/tools/godep Set up the repository for the package building tool \"newt\" on your local machine. First create the appropriate directory for it and then clone the newt tool repository from the online apache repository (or its github.com mirror) into this newly created directory. Check the contents of the directory. $ go get git-wip-us . apache . org/repos/asf/incubator-mynewt-newt . git/newt $ dir bin pkg src $ dir src git-wip-us . apache . org github . com gopkg . in $ dir newt $ cd newt $ dir Godeps README . md coding_style . txt newt . go LICENSE cli design . txt Check that newt is in place. $ dir $GOPATH\\src\\git-wip-us . apache . org\\repos\\asf\\incubator-mynewt-newt . git\\newt Godeps README . md coding_style . txt newt . go LICENSE cli design . txt Building the newt tool You will use Go to run the newt.go program to build the newt tool. The command used is go install which compiles and writes the resulting executable to an output file named newt . It installs the results along with its dependencies in $GOPATH/bin. $ go install $ ls \"$GOPATH\" /bin/ godep incubator-mynewt-newt . git newt Try running newt using the compiled binary. For example, check for the version number by typing 'newt version'. See all the possible commands available to a user of newt by typing 'newt -h'. Note: If you are going to be be modifying the newt tool itself often and wish to compile the program every time you call it, you may want to define the newt environment variable that allows you to execute the command via %newt% . Use set newt=go run %GOPATH%\\src\\github.com\\mynewt\\newt\\newt.go or set it from the GUI. Here, you use go run which runs the compiled binary directly without producing an executable. $ newt version Newt version : 1.0 $ newt -h Newt allows you to create your own embedded project based on the Mynewt operating system . Newt provides both build and package management in a single tool , which allows you to compose an embedded workspace , and set of projects , and then build the necessary artifacts from those projects . For more information on the Mynewt operating system , please visit https : //www.github.com/mynewt/documentation. Please use the newt help command , and specify the name of the command you want help for , for help on how to use a specific command Usage : newt [ flags ] newt [ command ] Examples : newt newt help [ <command-name> ] For help on <command-name> . If not specified , print this message . Available Commands : version Display the Newt version number . target Set and view target information egg Commands to list and inspect eggs on a nest nest Commands to manage nests & clutches ( remote egg repositories ) help Help about any command Flags : -h , --help= false : help for newt -l , --loglevel= \"WARN\" : Log level , defaults to WARN . -q , --quiet= false : Be quiet ; only display error output . -s , --silent= false : Be silent ; don't output anything . -v , --verbose= false : Enable verbose output when executing commands . Use \"newt help [command]\" for more information about a command . Without creating a project repository you can't do a whole lot with the Newt tool. So you'll have to wait till you have downloaded a nest to try out the tool. Getting the debugger ready Use Zadig to configure the USB driver for your Olimex debugger. If your debugger is already set up, you can skip this step. Plug in your Olimex debugger. Start Zadig. Check the Options -> List All Devices checkbox. Select \"Olimex OpenOCD JTAG ARM-USB-TINY-H\" in the dropdown menu. Select the \"WinUSB\" driver. Click the \"Install Driver\" button.

You can use it to get information about hardware interrupts, callout expirations, and messages from other tasks. The benefit of using events for inter-task communication is that it can reduce the number of resources that need to be shared and locked. The benefit of processing interrupts in a task context instead of the interrupt context is that other interrupts and high priority tasks are not blocked waiting for the interrupt handler to complete processing. A task can also access other OS facilities and sleep. This tutorial assumes that you have read about Event Queues , the Hardware Abstraction Layer , and OS Callouts in the OS User's Guide. This tutorial shows you how to create an application that uses events for: Inter-task communication OS callouts for timer expiration GPIO interrupts It also shows you how to: Use the Mynewt default event queue and application main task to process your events. Create a dedicated event queue and task for your events. To reduce an application's memory requirement, we recommend that you use the Mynewt default event queue if your application or package does not have real-time timing requirements. Prerequisites Ensure that you have met the following prerequisites before continuing with this tutorial: Install the newt tool. Install the newtmgr tool. Have Internet connectivity to fetch remote Mynewt components. Install the compiler tools to support native compiling to build the project this tutorial creates. Have a cable to establish a serial USB connection between the board and the laptop. Example Application In this example, you will write an application, for the Nordic nRF52 board, that uses events from three input sources to toggle three GPIO outputs and light up the LEDs. If you are using a different board, you will need to adjust the GPIO pin numbers in the code example. The application handles events from three sources on two event queues: Events generated by an application task at periodic intervals are added to the Mynewt default event queue. OS callouts for timer events are added to the my_timer_interrupt_eventq event queue. GPIO interrupt events are added to the my_timer_interrupt_eventq event queue. Create the Project Follow the instructions in the nRF52 tutorial to create a project. Create the Application Create the pkg.yml file for the application: pkg.name: apps/eventq_example pkg.type: app pkg.deps: - kernel/os - hw/hal - sys/console/stub Application Task Generated Events The application creates a task that generates events, at periodic intervals, to toggle the LED at pin TASK_LED . The event is queued on the Mynewt default event queue and is processed in the context of the application main task. Declare and initialize the gen_task_ev event with the my_ev_cb() callback function to process the event: /* Callback function for application task event */ static void my_ev_cb ( struct os_event * ); /* Initialize the event with the callback function */ static struct os_event gen_task_ev = { . ev_cb = my_ev_cb , }; Implement the my_ev_cb() callback function to process a task generated event and toggle the LED at pin TASK_LED : /* LED 1 (P0.17 on the board) */ #define TASK_LED 17 /* * Event callback function for events generated by gen_task.

For this example, we use a dedicated event queue for timer events to show you how to create a dedicated event queue and a task to process the events. Implement the my_timer_ev_cb() callback function to process a timer event and toggle the LED at pin CALLOUT_LED : /* LED 2 (P0.18 on the board) */ #define CALLOUT_LED 18 /* The timer callout */ static struct os_callout my_callout ; /* * Event callback function for timer events.

The interrupt handler generates an event when the GPIO for button 1 (P0.13) changes state. The events are added to the my_timer_interrupt_eventq event queue, the same queue as the timer events. Declare and initialize the gpio_ev event with the my_interrupt_ev_cb() callback function to process the event: static struct os_event gpio_ev { . ev_cb = my_interrupt_ev_cb , }; Implement the my_interrupt_ev_cb() callback function to process an interrupt event and toggle the LED at pin GPIO_LED : /* LED 3 (P0.19 on the board) */ #define GPIO_LED 19 /* * Event callback function for interrupt events. It toggles the LED at pin GPIO_LED. */ static void my_interrupt_ev_cb ( struct os_event *ev ) { assert ( ev != NULL ); hal_gpio_toggle ( GPIO_LED ); } Implement the my_gpio_irq() handler to post an interrupt event to the my_timer_interrupt_eventq event queue: static void my_gpio_irq ( void *arg ) { os_eventq_put ( &my_timer_interrupt_eventq , &gpio_ev ); } In the init_tasks() function, add the code to set up and enable the GPIO input pin for the button and initialize the GPIO output pins for the LEDs: /* LED 1 (P0.17 on the board) */ #define TASK_LED 17 /* 2 (P0.18 on the board) */ #define CALLOUT_LED 18 /* LED 3 (P0.19 on the board) */ #define GPIO_LED 19 /* Button 1 (P0.13 on the board) */ #define BUTTON1_PIN 13 void init_tasks () /* Initialize OS callout for timer events. */ .... /* * Initialize and enable interrupts for the pin for button 1 and * configure the button with pull up resistor on the nrf52dk. */ hal_gpio_irq_init ( BUTTON1_PIN , my_gpio_irq , NULL , HAL_GPIO_TRIG_RISING , HAL_GPIO_PULL_UP ); hal_gpio_irq_enable ( BUTTON1_PIN ); /* Initialize the GPIO output pins.

J-Link>exit $ So you have a BLE app, but really all you've done is change the name of the bleprph app to nrf52_adc and load that. Not all that impressive, and it certainly won't read an Analog Sensor right now. So let's do that next. In order to read an ADC sensor, and since the ADC package is in an external, licensed, repository, we'll create a driver for it here in our app that will leverage the existing driver in the external repository. It adds another layer of indirection, but it will also give us a look at building our own driver, so we'll do it this way. Building a Driver The first thing to do is to create the directory structure for your driver: [user@IsMyLaptop:~/src/air_quality]$ mkdir -p libs/my_drivers/myadc/include/myadc [user@IsMyLaptop:~/src/air_quality]$ mkdir -p libs/my_drivers/myadc/src Now you can add the files you need. You'll need a pkg.yml to describe the driver, and then header stub followed by source stub.

It's a pretty straightforward header file, since we only need to do 2 things: Initialize the ADC device Read ADC Values #ifndef _NRF52_ADC_H_ #define _NRF52_ADC_H_ void * adc_init ( void ); int adc_read ( void *buffer , int buffer_len ); #endif /* _NRF52_ADC_H_ */ Next we'll need a corresponding source file myadc.c in the src directory. This is where we'll implement the specifics of the driver: #include <assert.h> #include <os/os.h> /* ADC */ #include \"myadc/myadc.h\" #include \"nrf.h\" #include \"app_util_platform.h\" #include \"app_error.h\" #include <adc/adc.h> #include <adc_nrf52/adc_nrf52.h> #include \"nrf_drv_saadc.h\" #define ADC_NUMBER_SAMPLES (2) #define ADC_NUMBER_CHANNELS (1) nrf_drv_saadc_config_t adc_config = NRF_DRV_SAADC_DEFAULT_CONFIG ; struct adc_dev *adc ; uint8_t *sample_buffer1 ; uint8_t *sample_buffer2 ; static struct adc_dev os_bsp_adc0 ; static nrf_drv_saadc_config_t os_bsp_adc0_config = { . resolution = MYNEWT_VAL ( ADC_0_RESOLUTION ), . oversample = MYNEWT_VAL ( ADC_0_OVERSAMPLE ), . interrupt_priority = MYNEWT_VAL ( ADC_0_INTERRUPT_PRIORITY ), }; void * adc_init ( void ) { int rc = 0 ; rc = os_dev_create (( struct os_dev * ) &os_bsp_adc0 , \"adc0\" , OS_DEV_INIT_KERNEL , OS_DEV_INIT_PRIO_DEFAULT , nrf52_adc_dev_init , &os_bsp_adc0_config ); assert ( rc == 0 ); nrf_saadc_channel_config_t cc = NRF_DRV_SAADC_DEFAULT_CHANNEL_CONFIG_SE ( NRF_SAADC_INPUT_AIN1 ); cc . gain = NRF_SAADC_GAIN1_6 ; cc . reference = NRF_SAADC_REFERENCE_INTERNAL ; adc = ( struct adc_dev * ) os_dev_open ( \"adc0\" , 0 , &adc_config ); assert ( adc != NULL ); adc_chan_config ( adc , 0 , &cc ); sample_buffer1 = malloc ( adc_buf_size ( adc , ADC_NUMBER_CHANNELS , ADC_NUMBER_SAMPLES )); sample_buffer2 = malloc ( adc_buf_size ( adc , ADC_NUMBER_CHANNELS , ADC_NUMBER_SAMPLES )); memset ( sample_buffer1 , 0 , adc_buf_size ( adc , ADC_NUMBER_CHANNELS , ADC_NUMBER_SAMPLES )); memset ( sample_buffer2 , 0 , adc_buf_size ( adc , ADC_NUMBER_CHANNELS , ADC_NUMBER_SAMPLES )); adc_buf_set ( adc , sample_buffer1 , sample_buffer2 , adc_buf_size ( adc , ADC_NUMBER_CHANNELS , ADC_NUMBER_SAMPLES )); return adc ; } int adc_read ( void *buffer , int buffer_len ) { int i ; int adc_result ; int my_result_mv = 0 ; int rc ; for ( i = 0 ; i < ADC_NUMBER_SAMPLES ; i++ ) { rc = adc_buf_read ( adc , buffer , buffer_len , i , &adc_result ); if ( rc != 0 ) { goto err ; } my_result_mv = adc_result_mv ( adc , 0 , adc_result ); } adc_buf_release ( adc , buffer , buffer_len ); return my_result_mv ; err : return ( rc ); } There's a lot going on in here, so let's walk through it step by step. First, we define a default configuration, with the resolution, oversample and interrupt priority. You'll see that these are MYNEWT_VAL values, which means that we'll define them shortly in a syscfg.yml file to be passed to the compiler at build time. static struct adc_dev os_bsp_adc0 ; static nrf_drv_saadc_config_t os_bsp_adc0_config = { . resolution = MYNEWT_VAL ( ADC_0_RESOLUTION ), . oversample = MYNEWT_VAL ( ADC_0_OVERSAMPLE ), . interrupt_priority = MYNEWT_VAL ( ADC_0_INTERRUPT_PRIORITY ), }; Next, in adc_init() , we need to tell the OS to create the device. void * adc_init ( void ) { int rc = 0 ; rc = os_dev_create (( struct os_dev * ) &os_bsp_adc0 , \"adc0\" , OS_DEV_INIT_KERNEL , OS_DEV_INIT_PRIO_DEFAULT , nrf52_adc_dev_init , &os_bsp_adc0_config ); assert ( rc == 0 ); nrf_saadc_channel_config_t cc = NRF_DRV_SAADC_DEFAULT_CHANNEL_CONFIG_SE ( NRF_SAADC_INPUT_AIN1 ); cc . gain = NRF_SAADC_GAIN1_6 ; cc . reference = NRF_SAADC_REFERENCE_INTERNAL ; adc = ( struct adc_dev * ) os_dev_open ( \"adc0\" , 0 , &adc_config ); assert ( adc != NULL ); adc_chan_config ( adc , 0 , &cc ); sample_buffer1 = malloc ( adc_buf_size ( adc , ADC_NUMBER_CHANNELS , ADC_NUMBER_SAMPLES )); sample_buffer2 = malloc ( adc_buf_size ( adc , ADC_NUMBER_CHANNELS , ADC_NUMBER_SAMPLES )); memset ( sample_buffer1 , 0 , adc_buf_size ( adc , ADC_NUMBER_CHANNELS , ADC_NUMBER_SAMPLES )); memset ( sample_buffer2 , 0 , adc_buf_size ( adc , ADC_NUMBER_CHANNELS , ADC_NUMBER_SAMPLES )); adc_buf_set ( adc , sample_buffer1 , sample_buffer2 , adc_buf_size ( adc , ADC_NUMBER_CHANNELS , ADC_NUMBER_SAMPLES )); return adc ; } A few things need to be said about this part, as it is the most confusing. First, we're using a default configuration for the ADC Channel via the NRF_DRV_SAADC_DEFAULT_CHANNEL_CONFIG_SE macro. The important part here is that we're actually using AIN1 . I know what you're thinking, \"But we want ADC-0!\" and that's true. The board is actually labelled 'A0, A1, A2' etc., and the actual pin numbers are also listed on the board, which seems handy. At first. But it gets messy very quickly. If you try to use AIN0, and then go poke around in the registers while this is running, (gdb) p/x {NRF_SAADC_Type}0x40007000 ... CH = {{ PSELP = 0x1, PSELN = 0x0, CONFIG = 0x20000, LIMIT = 0x7fff8000 }, You'll see that the pin for channel 0 is set to 1, which corresponds to AIN0, but that's NOT the same as A0 -- pin P0.03, the one we're using. For that, you use AIN1, which would set the pin value to 2. Messy. Someone, somewhere, thought this made sense. The only other thing to note here is that we're using the internal reference voltage, rather than setting our own. There's nothing wrong with that, but since we are, we'll have to crank up the gain a bit by using NRF_SAADC_GAIN1_6 . Then, in adc_read() we will take readings, convert the raw readings to a millivolt equivalent, and return the result. int adc_read ( void *buffer , int buffer_len ) { int i ; int adc_result ; int my_result_mv = 0 ; int rc ; for ( i = 0 ; i < ADC_NUMBER_SAMPLES ; i++ ) { rc = adc_buf_read ( adc , buffer , buffer_len , i , &adc_result ); if ( rc != 0 ) { goto err ; } my_result_mv = adc_result_mv ( adc , 0 , adc_result ); } adc_buf_release ( adc , buffer , buffer_len ); return my_result_mv ; err : return ( rc ); } Finally, we'll need some settings for our driver, as mentioned earlier. In the myadc directory you'll need to add a syscfg.yml file: # Package: libs/my_driver/myadc syscfg.defs: ADC_0: description: 'TBD' value: 1 ADC_0_RESOLUTION: description: 'TBD' value: 'SAADC_CONFIG_RESOLUTION' ADC_0_OVERSAMPLE: description: 'TBD' value: 'SAADC_CONFIG_OVERSAMPLE' ADC_0_INTERRUPT_PRIORITY: description: 'TBD' value: 'SAADC_CONFIG_IRQ_PRIORITY' Once that's all done, you should have a working ADC Driver for your NRF52DK board. The last step in getting the driver set up is to include it in the package dependency defined by pkg.deps in the pkg.yml file of your app. Add it in apps/nrf52_adc/pkg.yml as shown by the highlighted line below. # Licensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) under one # <snip> pkg.name: apps/nrf52_adc pkg.type: app pkg.description: Simple BLE peripheral application for ADC sensor. pkg.author: \"Apache Mynewt <dev@mynewt.incubator.apache.org>\" pkg.homepage: \"http://mynewt.apache.org/\" pkg.keywords: pkg.deps: - \"@apache-mynewt-core/boot/split\" - \"@apache-mynewt-core/kernel/os\" - \"@apache-mynewt-core/mgmt/imgmgr\" - \"@apache-mynewt-core/mgmt/newtmgr\" - \"@apache-mynewt-core/mgmt/newtmgr/transport/ble\" - \"@apache-mynewt-core/net/nimble/controller\" - \"@apache-mynewt-core/net/nimble/host\" - \"@apache-mynewt-core/net/nimble/host/services/ans\" - \"@apache-mynewt-core/net/nimble/host/services/gap\" - \"@apache-mynewt-core/net/nimble/host/services/gatt\" - \"@apache-mynewt-core/net/nimble/host/store/ram\" - \"@apache-mynewt-core/net/nimble/transport/ram\" - \"@apache-mynewt-core/sys/console/full\" - \"@apache-mynewt-core/sys/log/full\" - \"@apache-mynewt-core/sys/stats/full\" - \"@apache-mynewt-core/sys/sysinit\" - \"@apache-mynewt-core/sys/id\" - libs/my_drivers/myadc Creating the ADC Task Now that the driver is done, we'll need to add calls to the main app's main.c file, as well as a few other things. First, we'll need to update the includes, and add a task for our ADC sampling. #include \"myadc/myadc.h\" ... /* ADC Task settings */ #define ADC_TASK_PRIO 5 #define ADC_STACK_SIZE (OS_STACK_ALIGN(336)) struct os_eventq adc_evq ; struct os_task adc_task ; bssnz_t os_stack_t adc_stack [ ADC_STACK_SIZE ]; Next we'll need o initialize the task event_q so we'll add the highlighted code to main() as shown below: /* Set the default device name. */ rc = ble_svc_gap_device_name_set ( \"nimble-adc\" ); assert ( rc == 0 ); conf_load (); /* Initialize adc sensor task eventq */ os_eventq_init ( &adc_evq ); /* Create the ADC reader task. * All sensor operations are performed in this task. */ os_task_init ( &adc_task , \"sensor\" , adc_task_handler , NULL , ADC_TASK_PRIO , OS_WAIT_FOREVER , adc_stack , ADC_STACK_SIZE ); We'll need that adc_task_handler() function to exist, and that's where we'll initialize the ADC Device and set the event handler. In the task's while() loop, we'll just make a call to adc_sample() to cause the ADC driver to sample the adc device. /** * Event loop for the sensor task. */ static void adc_task_handler ( void *unused ) { struct adc_dev *adc ; int rc ; /* ADC init */ adc = adc_init (); rc = adc_event_handler_set ( adc , adc_read_event , ( void * ) NULL ); assert ( rc == 0 ); while ( 1 ) { adc_sample ( adc ); /* Wait 2 second */ os_time_delay ( OS_TICKS_PER_SEC * 2 ); } } Above the adc_task_handler , add code to handle the adc_read_event() calls: int adc_read_event ( struct adc_dev *dev , void *arg , uint8_t etype , void *buffer , int buffer_len ) { int value ; uint16_t chr_val_handle ; int rc ; value = adc_read ( buffer , buffer_len ); if ( value >= 0 ) { console_printf ( \"Got %d\\n\" , value ); } else { console_printf ( \"Error while reading: %d\\n\" , value ); goto err ; } gatt_adc_val = value ; rc = ble_gatts_find_chr ( &gatt_svr_svc_adc_uuid . u , BLE_UUID16_DECLARE ( ADC_SNS_VAL ), NULL , &chr_val_handle ); assert ( rc == 0 ); ble_gatts_chr_updated ( chr_val_handle ); return ( 0 ); err : return ( rc ); } This is where we actually read the ADC value and then update the BLE Characteristic for that value. But wait, we haven't defined those BLE services and characteristics yet! Right, so don't try to build and run this app just yet or it will surely fail. Instead, move on to the next section and get all of those services defined. Building the BLE Services If the nrf52_adc app is going to be a Bluetooth-enabled sensor app that will allow you to read the value of the eTape Water Level Sensor via Bluetooth we'll need to actually define those Services and Characteristics. As with the ble peripheral app, we will advertise a couple of values from our app. The first is not strictly necessary, but it will help us build an iOS app later. We've defined a service and the characteristics in that service in bleadc.h in the apps/nrf52_adc/src/ directory as follows: /* Sensor Data */ /* e761d2af-1c15-4fa7-af80-b5729002b340 */ static const ble_uuid128_t gatt_svr_svc_adc_uuid = BLE_UUID128_INIT ( 0x40 , 0xb3 , 0x20 , 0x90 , 0x72 , 0xb5 , 0x80 , 0xaf , 0xa7 , 0x4f , 0x15 , 0x1c , 0xaf , 0xd2 , 0x61 , 0xe7 ); #define ADC_SNS_TYPE 0xDEAD #define ADC_SNS_STRING \"eTape Liquid Level Sensor\" #define ADC_SNS_VAL 0xBEAD extern uint16_t gatt_adc_val ; The first is the UUID of the service, followed by the 2 characteristics we are going to offer. The first characteristic is going to advertise the type of sensor we are advertising, and it will be a read-only characteristic. The second characteristic will be the sensor value itself, and we will allow connected devices to 'subscribe' to it in order to get constantly-updated values. Note: You can choose any valid Characteristic UUIDs to go here. We're using these values for illustrative purposes only. The value that we'll be updating is also defined here as gatt_adc_val . If we then go look at gatt_srv.c we can see the structure of the service and characteristic offering that we set up: static const struct ble_gatt_svc_def gatt_svr_svcs [] = { { /*** Service: Security test. */ . type = BLE_GATT_SVC_TYPE_PRIMARY , . uuid = &gatt_svr_svc_sec_test_uuid . u , . characteristics = ( struct ble_gatt_chr_def []) { { /*** Characteristic: Random number generator. */ . uuid = &gatt_svr_chr_sec_test_rand_uuid . u , . access_cb = gatt_svr_chr_access_sec_test , . flags = BLE_GATT_CHR_F_READ | BLE_GATT_CHR_F_READ_ENC , }, { /*** Characteristic: Static value. */ . uuid = &gatt_svr_chr_sec_test_static_uuid . u , . access_cb = gatt_svr_chr_access_sec_test , . flags = BLE_GATT_CHR_F_READ | BLE_GATT_CHR_F_WRITE | BLE_GATT_CHR_F_WRITE_ENC , }, { 0 , /* No more characteristics in this service. */ } }, }, { /*** ADC Level Notification Service. */ . type = BLE_GATT_SVC_TYPE_PRIMARY , . uuid = &gatt_svr_svc_adc_uuid . u , . characteristics = ( struct ble_gatt_chr_def []) { { . uuid = BLE_UUID16_DECLARE ( ADC_SNS_TYPE ), . access_cb = gatt_svr_sns_access , . flags = BLE_GATT_CHR_F_READ , }, { . uuid = BLE_UUID16_DECLARE ( ADC_SNS_VAL ), . access_cb = gatt_svr_sns_access , . flags = BLE_GATT_CHR_F_NOTIFY , }, { 0 , /* No more characteristics in this service. */ } }, }, { 0 , /* No more services. */ }, }; You should recognize the first services from the BLE Peripheral tutorial earlier. We're just adding another Service, with 2 new Characteristics, to that application. We'll need to fill in the function that will be called for this service, gatt_srv_sns_access next so that the service knows what to do. static int gatt_svr_sns_access ( uint16_t conn_handle , uint16_t attr_handle , struct ble_gatt_access_ctxt *ctxt , void *arg ) { uint16_t uuid16 ; int rc ; uuid16 = ble_uuid_u16 ( ctxt->chr->uuid ); switch ( uuid16 ) { case ADC_SNS_TYPE : assert ( ctxt->op == BLE_GATT_ACCESS_OP_READ_CHR ); rc = os_mbuf_append ( ctxt->om , ADC_SNS_STRING , sizeof ADC_SNS_STRING ); BLEPRPH_LOG ( INFO , \"ADC SENSOR TYPE READ: %s\\n\" , ADC_SNS_STRING ); return rc == 0 ? 0 : BLE_ATT_ERR_INSUFFICIENT_RES ; case ADC_SNS_VAL : if ( ctxt->op == BLE_GATT_ACCESS_OP_WRITE_CHR ) { rc = gatt_svr_chr_write ( ctxt->om , 0 , sizeof gatt_adc_val , &gatt_adc_val , NULL ); return rc ; } else if ( ctxt->op == BLE_GATT_ACCESS_OP_READ_CHR ) { rc = os_mbuf_append ( ctxt->om , &gatt_adc_val , sizeof gatt_adc_val ); return rc == 0 ? 0 : BLE_ATT_ERR_INSUFFICIENT_RES ; } default : assert ( 0 ); return BLE_ATT_ERR_UNLIKELY ; } } You can see that when request is for the ADC_SNS_TYPE , we return the Sensor Type we defined earlier. If the request if for ADC_SNS_VAL we'll return the gatt_adc_val value. Don't forget to include the bleadc.h include file at the top of the gatt_svr.c file! #include <assert.h> #include <stdio.h> #include <string.h> #include \"bsp/bsp.h\" #include \"host/ble_hs.h\" #include \"host/ble_uuid.h\" #include \"bleprph.h\" #include \"bleadc.h\" If you build, load and run this application now, you will see all those Services and Characteristics advertised, and you will even be able to read the \"Sensor Type\" String via the ADC_SNS_TYPE Characteristic. Adding the eTape Water Sensor Now that we have a fully functioning BLE App that we can subscribe to sensor values from, it's time to actually wire up the sensor! As previously mentioned, we're going to be using an eTape Water Level Sensor. You can get one from Adafruit . We're going to use the sensor as a resistive sensor, and the setup is very simple. I'll be using a 'breadboard` to put this all together for illustrative purposes. First, attach a jumper-wire from Vdd on the board to the breadboard. Next, attach a jumper wire from pin P0.03 on the board to the breadboard. This will be our ADC-in. The sensor should have come with a 560 ohm resistor, so plug that into the board between Vdd and ADC-in holes. Finally, attach a jumper from GND on the board to your breadboard. At this point, your breadboard should look like this: Now attach one of the middle 2 leads from the sensor to ground on the breadboard and the other middle lead to the ADC-in on the breadboard. Your breadboard should now look like this: And your eTape Sensor should look like this (at least if you have it mounted in a graduated cylinder as I do). That concludes the hardware portion. Easy! At this point you should be able to build, create-image and load your application and see it properly sending readings. Conclusion Congratulations, you've now completed both a hardware project and a software project by connecting a sensor to your device and using Mynewt to read data from that sensor and send it via Bluetooth to a connected device. That's no small feat! If you see anything missing or want to send us feedback, please do so by signing up for appropriate mailing lists on our Community Page . Keep on hacking and sensing! Note If you're wondering how to actually view these sensor readings via Bluetooth, you have a couple of options. On Mac OS or iOS you can download the LightBlue app . This app lets you connect to, and interrogate, BLE devices like the one you just built. If you used the BLE Service and Characteristic UUIDs used in this tutorial, you can also download and use a Mac OS MyNewt Sensor Reader App (Zip Archive) that allows you to graph your data, etc. An iOS version is in Beta testing and should be available soon.

In order to read an ADC sensor, and since the ADC package is in an external, licensed, repository, we'll create a driver for it here in our app that will leverage the existing driver in the external repository.

It's a pretty straightforward header file, since we only need to do 2 things: Initialize the ADC device Read ADC Values #ifndef _NRF52_ADC_H_ #define _NRF52_ADC_H_ void * adc_init ( void ); int adc_read ( void *buffer , int buffer_len ); #endif /* _NRF52_ADC_H_ */ Next we'll need a corresponding source file myadc.c in the src directory. This is where we'll implement the specifics of the driver: #include <assert.h> #include <os/os.h> /* ADC */ #include \"myadc/myadc.h\" #include \"nrf.h\" #include \"app_util_platform.h\" #include \"app_error.h\" #include <adc/adc.h> #include <adc_nrf52/adc_nrf52.h> #include \"nrf_drv_saadc.h\" #define ADC_NUMBER_SAMPLES (2) #define ADC_NUMBER_CHANNELS (1) nrf_drv_saadc_config_t adc_config = NRF_DRV_SAADC_DEFAULT_CONFIG ; struct adc_dev *adc ; uint8_t *sample_buffer1 ; uint8_t *sample_buffer2 ; static struct adc_dev os_bsp_adc0 ; static nrf_drv_saadc_config_t os_bsp_adc0_config = { . resolution = MYNEWT_VAL ( ADC_0_RESOLUTION ), . oversample = MYNEWT_VAL ( ADC_0_OVERSAMPLE ), . interrupt_priority = MYNEWT_VAL ( ADC_0_INTERRUPT_PRIORITY ), }; void * adc_init ( void ) { int rc = 0 ; rc = os_dev_create (( struct os_dev * ) &os_bsp_adc0 , \"adc0\" , OS_DEV_INIT_KERNEL , OS_DEV_INIT_PRIO_DEFAULT , nrf52_adc_dev_init , &os_bsp_adc0_config ); assert ( rc == 0 ); nrf_saadc_channel_config_t cc = NRF_DRV_SAADC_DEFAULT_CHANNEL_CONFIG_SE ( NRF_SAADC_INPUT_AIN1 ); cc . gain = NRF_SAADC_GAIN1_6 ; cc . reference = NRF_SAADC_REFERENCE_INTERNAL ; adc = ( struct adc_dev * ) os_dev_open ( \"adc0\" , 0 , &adc_config ); assert ( adc != NULL ); adc_chan_config ( adc , 0 , &cc ); sample_buffer1 = malloc ( adc_buf_size ( adc , ADC_NUMBER_CHANNELS , ADC_NUMBER_SAMPLES )); sample_buffer2 = malloc ( adc_buf_size ( adc , ADC_NUMBER_CHANNELS , ADC_NUMBER_SAMPLES )); memset ( sample_buffer1 , 0 , adc_buf_size ( adc , ADC_NUMBER_CHANNELS , ADC_NUMBER_SAMPLES )); memset ( sample_buffer2 , 0 , adc_buf_size ( adc , ADC_NUMBER_CHANNELS , ADC_NUMBER_SAMPLES )); adc_buf_set ( adc , sample_buffer1 , sample_buffer2 , adc_buf_size ( adc , ADC_NUMBER_CHANNELS , ADC_NUMBER_SAMPLES )); return adc ; } int adc_read ( void *buffer , int buffer_len ) { int i ; int adc_result ; int my_result_mv = 0 ; int rc ; for ( i = 0 ; i < ADC_NUMBER_SAMPLES ; i++ ) { rc = adc_buf_read ( adc , buffer , buffer_len , i , &adc_result ); if ( rc != 0 ) { goto err ; } my_result_mv = adc_result_mv ( adc , 0 , adc_result ); } adc_buf_release ( adc , buffer , buffer_len ); return my_result_mv ; err : return ( rc ); } There's a lot going on in here, so let's walk through it step by step. First, we define a default configuration, with the resolution, oversample and interrupt priority. You'll see that these are MYNEWT_VAL values, which means that we'll define them shortly in a syscfg.yml file to be passed to the compiler at build time. static struct adc_dev os_bsp_adc0 ; static nrf_drv_saadc_config_t os_bsp_adc0_config = { . resolution = MYNEWT_VAL ( ADC_0_RESOLUTION ), . oversample = MYNEWT_VAL ( ADC_0_OVERSAMPLE ), . interrupt_priority = MYNEWT_VAL ( ADC_0_INTERRUPT_PRIORITY ), }; Next, in adc_init() , we need to tell the OS to create the device. void * adc_init ( void ) { int rc = 0 ; rc = os_dev_create (( struct os_dev * ) &os_bsp_adc0 , \"adc0\" , OS_DEV_INIT_KERNEL , OS_DEV_INIT_PRIO_DEFAULT , nrf52_adc_dev_init , &os_bsp_adc0_config ); assert ( rc == 0 ); nrf_saadc_channel_config_t cc = NRF_DRV_SAADC_DEFAULT_CHANNEL_CONFIG_SE ( NRF_SAADC_INPUT_AIN1 ); cc . gain = NRF_SAADC_GAIN1_6 ; cc . reference = NRF_SAADC_REFERENCE_INTERNAL ; adc = ( struct adc_dev * ) os_dev_open ( \"adc0\" , 0 , &adc_config ); assert ( adc != NULL ); adc_chan_config ( adc , 0 , &cc ); sample_buffer1 = malloc ( adc_buf_size ( adc , ADC_NUMBER_CHANNELS , ADC_NUMBER_SAMPLES )); sample_buffer2 = malloc ( adc_buf_size ( adc , ADC_NUMBER_CHANNELS , ADC_NUMBER_SAMPLES )); memset ( sample_buffer1 , 0 , adc_buf_size ( adc , ADC_NUMBER_CHANNELS , ADC_NUMBER_SAMPLES )); memset ( sample_buffer2 , 0 , adc_buf_size ( adc , ADC_NUMBER_CHANNELS , ADC_NUMBER_SAMPLES )); adc_buf_set ( adc , sample_buffer1 , sample_buffer2 , adc_buf_size ( adc , ADC_NUMBER_CHANNELS , ADC_NUMBER_SAMPLES )); return adc ; } A few things need to be said about this part, as it is the most confusing. First, we're using a default configuration for the ADC Channel via the NRF_DRV_SAADC_DEFAULT_CHANNEL_CONFIG_SE macro. The important part here is that we're actually using AIN1 . I know what you're thinking, \"But we want ADC-0!\" and that's true. The board is actually labelled 'A0, A1, A2' etc., and the actual pin numbers are also listed on the board, which seems handy. At first. But it gets messy very quickly. If you try to use AIN0, and then go poke around in the registers while this is running, (gdb) p/x {NRF_SAADC_Type}0x40007000 ... CH = {{ PSELP = 0x1, PSELN = 0x0, CONFIG = 0x20000, LIMIT = 0x7fff8000 }, You'll see that the pin for channel 0 is set to 1, which corresponds to AIN0, but that's NOT the same as A0 -- pin P0.03, the one we're using. For that, you use AIN1, which would set the pin value to 2. Messy. Someone, somewhere, thought this made sense. The only other thing to note here is that we're using the internal reference voltage, rather than setting our own. There's nothing wrong with that, but since we are, we'll have to crank up the gain a bit by using NRF_SAADC_GAIN1_6 . Then, in adc_read() we will take readings, convert the raw readings to a millivolt equivalent, and return the result. int adc_read ( void *buffer , int buffer_len ) { int i ; int adc_result ; int my_result_mv = 0 ; int rc ; for ( i = 0 ; i < ADC_NUMBER_SAMPLES ; i++ ) { rc = adc_buf_read ( adc , buffer , buffer_len , i , &adc_result ); if ( rc != 0 ) { goto err ; } my_result_mv = adc_result_mv ( adc , 0 , adc_result ); } adc_buf_release ( adc , buffer , buffer_len ); return my_result_mv ; err : return ( rc ); } Finally, we'll need some settings for our driver, as mentioned earlier. In the myadc directory you'll need to add a syscfg.yml file: # Package: libs/my_driver/myadc syscfg.defs: ADC_0: description: 'TBD' value: 1 ADC_0_RESOLUTION: description: 'TBD' value: 'SAADC_CONFIG_RESOLUTION' ADC_0_OVERSAMPLE: description: 'TBD' value: 'SAADC_CONFIG_OVERSAMPLE' ADC_0_INTERRUPT_PRIORITY: description: 'TBD' value: 'SAADC_CONFIG_IRQ_PRIORITY' Once that's all done, you should have a working ADC Driver for your NRF52DK board. The last step in getting the driver set up is to include it in the package dependency defined by pkg.deps in the pkg.yml file of your app. Add it in apps/nrf52_adc/pkg.yml as shown by the highlighted line below. # Licensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) under one # <snip> pkg.name: apps/nrf52_adc pkg.type: app pkg.description: Simple BLE peripheral application for ADC sensor. pkg.author: \"Apache Mynewt <dev@mynewt.incubator.apache.org>\" pkg.homepage: \"http://mynewt.apache.org/\" pkg.keywords: pkg.deps: - \"@apache-mynewt-core/boot/split\" - \"@apache-mynewt-core/kernel/os\" - \"@apache-mynewt-core/mgmt/imgmgr\" - \"@apache-mynewt-core/mgmt/newtmgr\" - \"@apache-mynewt-core/mgmt/newtmgr/transport/ble\" - \"@apache-mynewt-core/net/nimble/controller\" - \"@apache-mynewt-core/net/nimble/host\" - \"@apache-mynewt-core/net/nimble/host/services/ans\" - \"@apache-mynewt-core/net/nimble/host/services/gap\" - \"@apache-mynewt-core/net/nimble/host/services/gatt\" - \"@apache-mynewt-core/net/nimble/host/store/ram\" - \"@apache-mynewt-core/net/nimble/transport/ram\" - \"@apache-mynewt-core/sys/console/full\" - \"@apache-mynewt-core/sys/log/full\" - \"@apache-mynewt-core/sys/stats/full\" - \"@apache-mynewt-core/sys/sysinit\" - \"@apache-mynewt-core/sys/id\" - libs/my_drivers/myadc","title":"Building a Driver"},{"location":"os/tutorials/nrf52_adc/#creating-the-adc-task","text":"Now that the driver is done, we'll need to add calls to the main app's main.c file, as well as a few other things.

In the task's while() loop, we'll just make a call to adc_sample() to cause the ADC driver to sample the adc device. /** * Event loop for the sensor task. */ static void adc_task_handler ( void *unused ) { struct adc_dev *adc ; int rc ; /* ADC init */ adc = adc_init (); rc = adc_event_handler_set ( adc , adc_read_event , ( void * ) NULL ); assert ( rc == 0 ); while ( 1 ) { adc_sample ( adc ); /* Wait 2 second */ os_time_delay ( OS_TICKS_PER_SEC * 2 ); } } Above the adc_task_handler , add code to handle the adc_read_event() calls: int adc_read_event ( struct adc_dev *dev , void *arg , uint8_t etype , void *buffer , int buffer_len ) { int value ; uint16_t chr_val_handle ; int rc ; value = adc_read ( buffer , buffer_len ); if ( value >= 0 ) { console_printf ( \"Got %d\\n\" , value ); } else { console_printf ( \"Error while reading: %d\\n\" , value ); goto err ; } gatt_adc_val = value ; rc = ble_gatts_find_chr ( &gatt_svr_svc_adc_uuid . u , BLE_UUID16_DECLARE ( ADC_SNS_VAL ), NULL , &chr_val_handle ); assert ( rc == 0 ); ble_gatts_chr_updated ( chr_val_handle ); return ( 0 ); err : return ( rc ); } This is where we actually read the ADC value and then update the BLE Characteristic for that value. But wait, we haven't defined those BLE services and characteristics yet! Right, so don't try to build and run this app just yet or it will surely fail. Instead, move on to the next section and get all of those services defined.","title":"Creating the ADC Task"},{"location":"os/tutorials/nrf52_adc/#building-the-ble-services","text":"If the nrf52_adc app is going to be a Bluetooth-enabled sensor app that will allow you to read the value of the eTape Water Level Sensor via Bluetooth we'll need to actually define those Services and Characteristics. As with the ble peripheral app, we will advertise a couple of values from our app. The first is not strictly necessary, but it will help us build an iOS app later. We've defined a service and the characteristics in that service in bleadc.h in the apps/nrf52_adc/src/ directory as follows: /* Sensor Data */ /* e761d2af-1c15-4fa7-af80-b5729002b340 */ static const ble_uuid128_t gatt_svr_svc_adc_uuid = BLE_UUID128_INIT ( 0x40 , 0xb3 , 0x20 , 0x90 , 0x72 , 0xb5 , 0x80 , 0xaf , 0xa7 , 0x4f , 0x15 , 0x1c , 0xaf , 0xd2 , 0x61 , 0xe7 ); #define ADC_SNS_TYPE 0xDEAD #define ADC_SNS_STRING \"eTape Liquid Level Sensor\" #define ADC_SNS_VAL 0xBEAD extern uint16_t gatt_adc_val ; The first is the UUID of the service, followed by the 2 characteristics we are going to offer. The first characteristic is going to advertise the type of sensor we are advertising, and it will be a read-only characteristic. The second characteristic will be the sensor value itself, and we will allow connected devices to 'subscribe' to it in order to get constantly-updated values. Note: You can choose any valid Characteristic UUIDs to go here. We're using these values for illustrative purposes only. The value that we'll be updating is also defined here as gatt_adc_val . If we then go look at gatt_srv.c we can see the structure of the service and characteristic offering that we set up: static const struct ble_gatt_svc_def gatt_svr_svcs [] = { { /*** Service: Security test. */ . type = BLE_GATT_SVC_TYPE_PRIMARY , . uuid = &gatt_svr_svc_sec_test_uuid . u , . characteristics = ( struct ble_gatt_chr_def []) { { /*** Characteristic: Random number generator. */ . uuid = &gatt_svr_chr_sec_test_rand_uuid . u , . access_cb = gatt_svr_chr_access_sec_test , . flags = BLE_GATT_CHR_F_READ | BLE_GATT_CHR_F_READ_ENC , }, { /*** Characteristic: Static value. */ . uuid = &gatt_svr_chr_sec_test_static_uuid . u , . access_cb = gatt_svr_chr_access_sec_test , . flags = BLE_GATT_CHR_F_READ | BLE_GATT_CHR_F_WRITE | BLE_GATT_CHR_F_WRITE_ENC , }, { 0 , /* No more characteristics in this service. */ } }, }, { /*** ADC Level Notification Service. */ . type = BLE_GATT_SVC_TYPE_PRIMARY , . uuid = &gatt_svr_svc_adc_uuid . u , . characteristics = ( struct ble_gatt_chr_def []) { { . uuid = BLE_UUID16_DECLARE ( ADC_SNS_TYPE ), . access_cb = gatt_svr_sns_access , . flags = BLE_GATT_CHR_F_READ , }, { . uuid = BLE_UUID16_DECLARE ( ADC_SNS_VAL ), . access_cb = gatt_svr_sns_access , . flags = BLE_GATT_CHR_F_NOTIFY , }, { 0 , /* No more characteristics in this service. */ } }, }, { 0 , /* No more services. */ }, }; You should recognize the first services from the BLE Peripheral tutorial earlier. We're just adding another Service, with 2 new Characteristics, to that application. We'll need to fill in the function that will be called for this service, gatt_srv_sns_access next so that the service knows what to do. static int gatt_svr_sns_access ( uint16_t conn_handle , uint16_t attr_handle , struct ble_gatt_access_ctxt *ctxt , void *arg ) { uint16_t uuid16 ; int rc ; uuid16 = ble_uuid_u16 ( ctxt->chr->uuid ); switch ( uuid16 ) { case ADC_SNS_TYPE : assert ( ctxt->op == BLE_GATT_ACCESS_OP_READ_CHR ); rc = os_mbuf_append ( ctxt->om , ADC_SNS_STRING , sizeof ADC_SNS_STRING ); BLEPRPH_LOG ( INFO , \"ADC SENSOR TYPE READ: %s\\n\" , ADC_SNS_STRING ); return rc == 0 ? 0 : BLE_ATT_ERR_INSUFFICIENT_RES ; case ADC_SNS_VAL : if ( ctxt->op == BLE_GATT_ACCESS_OP_WRITE_CHR ) { rc = gatt_svr_chr_write ( ctxt->om , 0 , sizeof gatt_adc_val , &gatt_adc_val , NULL ); return rc ; } else if ( ctxt->op == BLE_GATT_ACCESS_OP_READ_CHR ) { rc = os_mbuf_append ( ctxt->om , &gatt_adc_val , sizeof gatt_adc_val ); return rc == 0 ? 0 : BLE_ATT_ERR_INSUFFICIENT_RES ; } default : assert ( 0 ); return BLE_ATT_ERR_UNLIKELY ; } } You can see that when request is for the ADC_SNS_TYPE , we return the Sensor Type we defined earlier. If the request if for ADC_SNS_VAL we'll return the gatt_adc_val value. Don't forget to include the bleadc.h include file at the top of the gatt_svr.c file! #include <assert.h> #include <stdio.h> #include <string.h> #include \"bsp/bsp.h\" #include \"host/ble_hs.h\" #include \"host/ble_uuid.h\" #include \"bleprph.h\" #include \"bleadc.h\" If you build, load and run this application now, you will see all those Services and Characteristics advertised, and you will even be able to read the \"Sensor Type\" String via the ADC_SNS_TYPE Characteristic.","title":"Building the BLE Services"},{"location":"os/tutorials/nrf52_adc/#adding-the-etape-water-sensor","text":"Now that we have a fully functioning BLE App that we can subscribe to sensor values from, it's time to actually wire up the sensor! As previously mentioned, we're going to be using an eTape Water Level Sensor. You can get one from Adafruit . We're going to use the sensor as a resistive sensor, and the setup is very simple. I'll be using a 'breadboard` to put this all together for illustrative purposes. First, attach a jumper-wire from Vdd on the board to the breadboard. Next, attach a jumper wire from pin P0.03 on the board to the breadboard. This will be our ADC-in. The sensor should have come with a 560 ohm resistor, so plug that into the board between Vdd and ADC-in holes. Finally, attach a jumper from GND on the board to your breadboard. At this point, your breadboard should look like this: Now attach one of the middle 2 leads from the sensor to ground on the breadboard and the other middle lead to the ADC-in on the breadboard. Your breadboard should now look like this: And your eTape Sensor should look like this (at least if you have it mounted in a graduated cylinder as I do). That concludes the hardware portion. Easy!

Refer to the following diagrams to locate the boot jumpers and power input select jumpers on the board. Note: The labels for the USB-OTG1 and USB-OTG2 ports on the diagram are reversed. The port labeled USB-OTG1 on the diagram is the USB-OTG2 port and the port labeled USB-OTG2 on the diagram is the USB-OTG1 port. Locate the boot jumpers on the lower right corner of the board. B1_1/B1_0 and B0_1/B0_0 are PTH jumpers to control the boot mode when a bootloader is present. These two jumpers must be moved together. The board searches for the bootloader in three places: User Flash Memory, System Memory or the Embedded SRAM. For this Blinky project, we configure the board to boot from flash by jumpering B0_0 and B1_0 . Note: The markings on the board may not always be accurate, and you should always refer to the manual for the correct positioning. Locate the Power Input Select jumpers on the lower left corner of the board. Set the Power Select jumpers to position 5 and 6 to use the USB-OTG2 port for the power source. If you would like to use a different power source, refer to the OLIMEX STM32-E407 user manual for pin specifications. Connect the USB Micro-A cable to the USB-OTG2 port on the board. Connect the JTAG connector to the JTAG/SWD interface on the board. Connect the USB A-B cable to the ARM-USB-TINY-H connector and your computer. Check that the red PWR LED lights up. Load the Bootloader and Blinky Application Run the newt load boot_olimex command to load the bootloader image onto the board: $newt load -v boot_olimex Loading bootloader Load command: ~/dev/myproj/repos/apache-mynewt-core/hw/bsp/olimex_stm32-e407_devboard/olimex_stm32-e407_devboard_download.sh ~/dev/myproj/repos/apache-mynewt-core/hw/bsp/olimex_stm32-e407_devboard ~/dev/myproj/bin/targets/boot_olimex/app/apps/boot/boot Successfully loaded image.

The LED should be blinking! Let's double check that it is indeed booting from flash and making the LED blink from the image in flash. Pull the USB cable off the Olimex JTAG adaptor, severing the debug connection to the JTAG port. Next power off the Olimex board by pulling out the USB cable from the board. Wait for a couple of seconds and plug the USB cable back to the board. The LED light will start blinking again. Success! If you want to download the image to flash and open a gdb session, use newt debug blinky . Note: The output of the debug session below is for Mac OS and Linux platforms. On Windows, openocd and gdb are started in separate Windows Command Prompt terminals, and the terminals are automatically closed when you quit gdb.

The port labeled USB-OTG1 on the diagram is the USB-OTG2 port and the port labeled USB-OTG2 on the diagram is the USB-OTG1 port. Locate the boot jumpers on the lower right corner of the board. B1_1/B1_0 and B0_1/B0_0 are PTH jumpers to control the boot mode when a bootloader is present. These two jumpers must be moved together. The board searches for the bootloader in three places: User Flash Memory, System Memory or the Embedded SRAM. For this Blinky project, we configure the board to boot from flash by jumpering B0_0 and B1_0 . Note: The markings on the board may not always be accurate, and you should always refer to the manual for the correct positioning. Locate the Power Input Select jumpers on the lower left corner of the board. Set the Power Select jumpers to position 5 and 6 to use the USB-OTG2 port for the power source. If you would like to use a different power source, refer to the OLIMEX STM32-E407 user manual for pin specifications. Connect the USB Micro-A cable to the USB-OTG2 port on the board.

The LED should be blinking! Let's double check that it is indeed booting from flash and making the LED blink from the image in flash. Pull the USB cable off the Olimex JTAG adaptor, severing the debug connection to the JTAG port. Next power off the Olimex board by pulling out the USB cable from the board. Wait for a couple of seconds and plug the USB cable back to the board. The LED light will start blinking again. Success! If you want to download the image to flash and open a gdb session, use newt debug blinky . Note: The output of the debug session below is for Mac OS and Linux platforms. On Windows, openocd and gdb are started in separate Windows Command Prompt terminals, and the terminals are automatically closed when you quit gdb. In addition, the output of openocd is logged to the openocd.log file in your project's base directory instead of the terminal.

You can also use the Windows Device Manager to find the COM port number. $ ls /dev/tty*usbserial* /dev/tty.usbserial-1d11 $ Setup a newtmgr connection profile for the serial port. For our example, the port is /dev/tty.usbserial-1d11 . Run the newtmgr conn add command to define a newtmgr connection profile for the serial port. We name the connection profile nrf52serial . Note : You will need to replace the connstring with the specific port for your serial connection. On Windows, you must specify COM<N+1> for the connstring if /dev/ttyS<N> is the serial port. $ newtmgr conn add nrf52serial type=serial connstring=/dev/tty.usbserial-1d11 Connection profile nrf52serial successfully added $ You can run the newt conn show command to see all the newtmgr connection profiles: $ newtmgr conn show Connection profiles: nrf52serial: type=serial, connstring='/dev/tty.usbserial-1d11' sim1: type=serial, connstring='/dev/ttys012' $","title":"Connect Newtmgr with the Board using a Serial Connection"},{"location":"os/tutorials/project-nrf52-slinky/#use-newtmgr-to-query-the-board","text":"Run some newtmgr commands to query and receive responses back from the board (See the Newt Manager Guide for more information on the newtmgr commands).

The schematic of the board can be found at https://www.olimex.com/Products/ARM/ST/STM32-E407/resources/STM32-E407_sch.pdf for reference. Connect the female RX pin of the USB-TTL serial cable to the TX (Pin 3) of the UEXT connector on the board. Connect the female TX pin of the USB-TTL serial cable to the RX (Pin 4) of the UEXT connector on the board. Connect the GND pin of the USB-TTL serial cable to the GND (Pin 2) of the UEXT connector on the board. Locate the port, in the /dev directory on your computer, that the serial connection uses. The format of the port name is platform dependent: Mac OS uses the format tty.usbserial-<some identifier> . Linux uses the format TTYUSB<N> , where N is a number. For example, TTYUSB2. MinGW on Windows uses the format ttyS<N> , where N is a number. You must map the port name to a Windows COM port: /dev/ttyS<N> maps to COM<N+1> . For example, /dev/ttyS2 maps to COM3 .

Specifically, this lesson will cover tasks, simple multitasking, and priority management running on an Arduino M0 Pro. Prerequisites Before starting, you should read about Mynewt in the Introduction section and complete the QuickStart guide and the Blinky tutorial. Furthermore, it may be helpful to take a peek at the task documentation for additional insights. Equipment You will need the following equipment: Arduino M0 Pro (or legacy Arduino Zero or Zero Pro, but not Arduino M0) Computer with Mynewt installed USB to Micro USB Cable Build Your Application To save time, we will simply modify the Blinky application. We'll add the Task Management code to the Blinky application. Follow the Arduino Zero Blinky tutorial to create a new project and build your bootloader and application. Finally, build and load the application to your Arduino to verify that everything is in order. Now let\u2019s get started! Default Main Task During Mynewt system startup, Mynewt creates a default main task and executes the application main() function in the context of this task. The main task priority defaults to 127 and can be configured with the OS_MAIN_TASK_PRIO system configuration setting. The blinky application only has the main task. The main() function executes an infinite loop that toggles the led and sleeps for one second. Create a New Task The purpose of this section is to give an introduction to the important aspects of tasks and how to properly initialize them. First, let\u2019s define a second task called work_task in main.c (located in apps/blinky/src): struct os_task work_task ; A task is represented by the os_task struct which will hold the task\u2019s information (name, state, priority, etc.). A task is made up of two main elements, a task function (also known as a task handler) and a task stack. Next, let\u2019s take a look at what is required to initialize our new task. Task Stack The task stack is an array of type os_stack_t which holds the program stack frames. Mynewt gives us the ability to set the stack size for a task giving the application developer room to optimize memory usage. Since we\u2019re not short on memory, our work_stack is plenty large for the purpose of this lesson. Notice that the elements in our task stack are of type os_stack_t which are generally 32 bits, making our entire stack 1024 Bytes. #define WORK_STACK_SIZE OS_STACK_ALIGN(256) Note: The OS_STACK_ALIGN macro is used to align the stack based on the hardware architecture. Task Function A task function is essentially an infinite loop that waits for some \u201cevent\u201d to wake it up. In general, the task function is where the majority of work is done by a task. Let\u2019s write a task function for work_task called work_task_handler() : void work_task_handler ( void *arg ) { struct os_task *t ; g_led_pin = LED_BLINK_PIN ; hal_gpio_init_out ( g_led_pin , 1 ); while ( 1 ) { t = os_sched_get_current_task (); assert ( t->t_func == work_task_handler ); /* Do work... */ } } The task function is called when the task is initially put into the running state by the scheduler. We use an infinite loop to ensure that the task function never returns. Our assertion that the current task's handler is the same as our task handler is for illustration purposes only and does not need to be in most task functions. Task Priority As a preemptive, multitasking RTOS, Mynewt decides which tasks to run based on which has a higher priority; the highest priority being 0 and the lowest 255. Thus, before initializing our task, we must choose a priority defined as a macro variable. Let\u2019s set the priority of work_task to 0, because everyone knows that work is more important than blinking. #define WORK_TASK_PRIO (0) Initialization To initialize a new task we use os_task_init() which takes a number of arguments including our new task function, stack, and priority. Add the init_tasks() function to initialize work_task to keep our main function clean. int init_tasks ( void ) { /* \u2026 */ os_stack_t *work_stack ; work_stack = malloc ( sizeof ( os_stack_t ) *WORK_STACK_SIZE ); assert ( work_stack ); os_task_init ( &work_task , \"work\" , work_task_handler , NULL , WORK_TASK_PRIO , OS_WAIT_FOREVER , work_stack , WORK_STACK_SIZE ); return 0 ; } Add the call to init_tasks() in main() before the while loop: int main ( int argc , char **argv ) { ... /* Initialize the work task */ init_tasks (); while ( 1 ) { ... } } And that\u2019s it! Now run your application using the newt run command. $ newt run arduino_blinky 0.0.0 When GDB appears press C then Enter to continue and \u2026 wait, why doesn't our LED blink anymore? Review Before we run our new app, let\u2019s review what we need in order to create a task. This is a general case for a new task called mytask: 1) Define a new task, task stack, and priority: /* My Task */ struct os_task mytask /* My Task Stack */ #define MYTASK_STACK_SIZE OS_STACK_ALIGN(256) os_stack_t mytask_stack [ MYTASK_STACK_SIZE ]; /* My Task Priority */ #define MYTASK_PRIO (0) 2) Define task function: void mytask_handler ( void *arg ) { while ( 1 ) { /* ... */ } } 3) Initialize the task: os_task_init ( &mytask , \"mytask\" , mytask_handler , NULL , MYTASK_PRIO , OS_WAIT_FOREVER , mytask_stack , MYTASK_STACK_SIZE ); Task Priority, Preempting, and Context Switching A preemptive RTOS is one in which a higher priority task that is ready to run will preempt (i.e. take the place of) the lower priority task which is running . When a lower priority task is preempted by a higher priority task, the lower priority task\u2019s context data (stack pointer, registers, etc.) is saved and the new task is switched in. In our example, work_task (priority 0) has a higher priority than the main task (priority 127). Since work_task is never put into a sleep state, it holds the processor focus on its context. Let\u2019s give work_task a delay and some simulated work to keep it busy. The delay is measured in os ticks and the actual number of ticks per second is dependent on the board. We multiply OS_TICKS_PER_SEC , which is defined in the MCU, by the number of seconds we wish to delay. void work_task_handler ( void *arg ) { struct os_task *t ; g_led_pin = LED_BLINK_PIN ; hal_gpio_init_out ( g_led_pin , 1 ); while ( 1 ) { t = os_sched_get_current_t : ask (); assert ( t->t_func == work_task_handler ); /* Do work... */ int i ; for ( i = 0 ; i < 1000000 ; ++i ) { /* Simulate doing a noticeable amount of work */ hal_gpio_write ( g_led_pin , 1 ); } os_time_delay ( 3 * OS_TICKS_PER_SEC ); } } In order to notice the LED changing, modify the time delay in main() to blink at a higher frequency. os_time_delay ( OS_TICKS_PER_SEC/ 10 ); Before we run the app, let\u2019s predict the behavior. With the newest additions to work_task_handler() , our first action will be to sleep for three seconds. This allows the main task, running main() , to take over the CPU and blink to its heart\u2019s content. After three seconds, work_task will wake up and be made ready to run . This causes it to preempt the main task. The LED will then remain lit for a short period while work_task loops, then blink again for another three seconds while work_task sleeps. You should see that our prediction was correct! Priority Management Considerations When projects grow in scope, from blinking LEDs into more sophisticated applications, the number of tasks needed increases alongside complexity. It remains important, then, that each of our tasks is capable of doing its work within a reasonable amount of time. Some tasks, such as the Shell task, execute quickly and require almost instantaneous response. Therefore, the Shell task should be given a high priority. On the other hand, tasks which may be communicating over a network, or processing data, should be given a low priority in order to not hog the CPU. The diagram below shows the different scheduling patterns we would expect when we set the work_task priority higher and lower than the main task priority. In the second case where the main task has a higher priority, work_task runs and executes \u201cwork\u201d when the main task sleeps, saving us idle time compared to the first case. Note: Defining the same priority for two tasks leads to somewhat undefined behavior and should be avoided.","title":"Tasks and Priority Management"},{"location":"os/tutorials/tasks_lesson/#tasks-and-priority-management","text":"Target Platform: Arduino M0 Pro (or legacy Arduino Zero or Zero Pro, but not Arduino M0) This lesson is designed to teach core OS concepts and strategies encountered when building applications using Mynewt.

When a lower priority task is preempted by a higher priority task, the lower priority task\u2019s context data (stack pointer, registers, etc.) is saved and the new task is switched in. In our example, work_task (priority 0) has a higher priority than the main task (priority 127). Since work_task is never put into a sleep state, it holds the processor focus on its context. Let\u2019s give work_task a delay and some simulated work to keep it busy. The delay is measured in os ticks and the actual number of ticks per second is dependent on the board. We multiply OS_TICKS_PER_SEC , which is defined in the MCU, by the number of seconds we wish to delay. void work_task_handler ( void *arg ) { struct os_task *t ; g_led_pin = LED_BLINK_PIN ; hal_gpio_init_out ( g_led_pin , 1 ); while ( 1 ) { t = os_sched_get_current_t : ask (); assert ( t->t_func == work_task_handler ); /* Do work... */ int i ; for ( i = 0 ; i < 1000000 ; ++i ) { /* Simulate doing a noticeable amount of work */ hal_gpio_write ( g_led_pin , 1 ); } os_time_delay ( 3 * OS_TICKS_PER_SEC ); } } In order to notice the LED changing, modify the time delay in main() to blink at a higher frequency. os_time_delay ( OS_TICKS_PER_SEC/ 10 ); Before we run the app, let\u2019s predict the behavior. With the newest additions to work_task_handler() , our first action will be to sleep for three seconds. This allows the main task, running main() , to take over the CPU and blink to its heart\u2019s content. After three seconds, work_task will wake up and be made ready to run . This causes it to preempt the main task. The LED will then remain lit for a short period while work_task loops, then blink again for another three seconds while work_task sleeps. You should see that our prediction was correct!","title":"Task Priority, Preempting, and Context Switching"},{"location":"os/tutorials/tasks_lesson/#priority-management-considerations","text":"When projects grow in scope, from blinking LEDs into more sophisticated applications, the number of tasks needed increases alongside complexity. It remains important, then, that each of our tasks is capable of doing its work within a reasonable amount of time. Some tasks, such as the Shell task, execute quickly and require almost instantaneous response. Therefore, the Shell task should be given a high priority. On the other hand, tasks which may be communicating over a network, or processing data, should be given a low priority in order to not hog the CPU. The diagram below shows the different scheduling patterns we would expect when we set the work_task priority higher and lower than the main task priority. In the second case where the main task has a higher priority, work_task runs and executes \u201cwork\u201d when the main task sleeps, saving us idle time compared to the first case.

Introduction Writing a test suite involves using the libs/testutil package within Mynewt core os. The testutil library provides the interface to the newt command tool and also provides the compile time hooks to include test suites into your code. Review the [ testutil introduction page ] (../modules/testutil/testutil.md) to learn about how the library works. Identify Your Package Identify the package for which you are writing a test suite. For this example we will use libs/json . To create a new package, see this Tutorial . Modify Pkg.yml Edit the package ( pkg.yml ) file for your package and add the test dependency for the Mynewt core OS libs/testutil . pkg . deps . TEST : - libs/testutil Create Your Test Suite Template Create a subdirectory test under your package main directory. Create a file pair for your test code and header files within the test directory created above. Below shows the libs/json directory within the Mynewt core, including the test directory. In this example, we used the convention test_xxx.c/h (in this case test_json ). \u251c\u2500\u2500 MSJSON_COPYING \u251c\u2500\u2500 include \u2502 \u2514\u2500\u2500 json \u2502 \u2514\u2500\u2500 json . h \u251c\u2500\u2500 pkg . yml \u2514\u2500\u2500 src \u251c\u2500\u2500 json_decode . c \u251c\u2500\u2500 json_encode . c \u2514\u2500\u2500 test \u251c\u2500\u2500 test_json . c \u2514\u2500\u2500 test_json . h Create Your Test Suite Code Edit the test_json.c file and add your test suite definition. NOTE that the test suite code requires #include <testutil/testutil.h> to get the Mynewt testutil definitions. Your test suite test_json.c file contains at a minimum two functions: A test Suite which is empty for now, but will contain calls to your test cases. A main function which must be #ifdef 'd using MYNEWT_SELFTEST to ensure that is does not get compiled in when this test suite is run with test suites from other packages Below shows the contents of the test_json.c file. #include <testutil/testutil.h> TEST_SUITE ( test_json_suite ) { /* empty for now, add test cases later */ } #ifdef MYNEWT_SELFTEST int main ( int argc , char **argv ) { tu_config . tc_print_results = 1 ; tu_init (); test_json_suite (); return tu_any_failed ; } #endif Try It Out At this point, you have a working test suite with no tests. This will by default pass the test. Your output will look something like this. You can use the newt test command to run the unit tests for any package. Just include the package name.

Follow These steps; 1. Create function prototypes in test_json.h for your test functions. A macro in testutil.h hides the actual prototype, but as of this writing the prototype is int test_func(void); . #ifndef TEST_JSON_H #define TEST_JSON_H TEST_CASE_DECL ( test_json_simple_encode ); TEST_CASE_DECL ( test_json_simple_decode ); #endif /* TEST_JSON_H 2. create a new file test_json_simple.c to define these two functions.

On the MKR1000 board, the TX pin is PIN 14 and the RX pin in PIN 13. Locate the port, in the /dev directory on your computer, that the serial connection uses. The format of the port name is platform dependent: Mac OS uses the format tty.usbserial-<some identifier> . Linux uses the format TTYUSB<N> , where N is a number. For example, TTYUSB2. MinGW on Windows uses the format ttyS<N> , where N is a number. You must map the port name to a Windows COM port: /dev/ttyS<N> maps to COM<N+1> . For example, /dev/ttyS2 maps to COM3 . You can also use the Windows Device Manager to find the COM port number. $ ls /dev/tty*usbserial* /dev/tty.usbserial-1d13 $ Start Wi-Fi via console Use a terminal emulation program to communicate with the board over the serial port.

An advertisement typically contains additional information about the peripheral sending it, such as the device name and an abbreviated list of supported services. The presence of this information helps a listening central to determine whether it is interested in connecting to the peripheral. Advertisements are quite limited in the amount of information they can contain, so only the most important information should be included. When a listening device receives an advertisement, it can choose to connect to the peripheral, or query the sender for more information. This second action is known as an active scan . A peripheral responds to an active scan with some extra information that it couldn't fit in its advertisement. This additional information is known as scan response data . bleprph does not configure any scan response data, so this feature is not discussed in the remainder of this tutorial. bleprph constantly broadcasts advertisements until a central connects to it. When a connection is terminated, bleprph resumes advertising. Let's take a look at bleprph 's advertisement code ( main.c ): /** * Enables advertising with the following parameters: * o General discoverable mode. * o Undirected connectable mode. */ static void bleprph_advertise ( void ) { struct ble_gap_adv_params adv_params ; struct ble_hs_adv_fields fields ; const char *name ; int rc ; /** * Set the advertisement data included in our advertisements: * o Flags (indicates advertisement type and other general info). * o Advertising tx power. * o Device name. * o 16-bit service UUIDs (alert notifications). */ memset ( &fields , 0 , sizeof fields ); /* Indicate that the flags field should be included; specify a value of 0 * to instruct the stack to fill the value in for us. */ fields . flags_is_present = 1 ; fields . flags = 0 ; /* Indicate that the TX power level field should be included; have the * stack fill this one automatically as well.

Setting advertisement data A NimBLE peripheral specifies what information to include in its advertisements with the ble_gap_adv_set_fields() function. The fields argument specifies the fields and their contents to include in subsequent advertisements. The Bluetooth Core Specification Supplement defines a set of standard fields that can be included in an advertisement; the member variables of the struct ble_hs_adv_fields type correspond to these standard fields. Information that doesn't fit neatly into a standard field should be put in the manufacturing specific data field. As you can see in the above code listing, the struct ble_hs_adv_fields instance is allocated on the stack. It is OK to use the stack for this struct and the data it references, as the ble_gap_adv_set_fields() function makes a copy of all the advertisement data before it returns. bleprph doesn't take full advantange of this; it stores its device name in a static array. The code sets several members of the struct ble_hs_adv_fields instance. Most of them are quite straight-forward. However, the name_is_complete field requires some explanation. Bluetooth specifies two name-related advertisement fields: Shortened Local Name and Complete Local Name . Setting the name_is_complete variable to 1 or 0 tells NimBLE which of these two fields to include in advertisements. Some other advertisement fields also correspond to multiple variables in the field struct, so it is a good idea to review the ble_hs_adv_fields reference to make sure you get the details right in your app. Begin advertising An app starts advertising with ble_gap_adv_start() function. This function allows a lot of flexibility, and it might seem daunting at first glance. bleprph specifies a simple set of arguments that is appropriate for most peripherals. When getting started on a typical peripheral, we recommend you use the same arguments as bleprph , with the exception of the last two ( cb and cb_arg ; bleprph_gap_event and NULL in this case). These last two arguments will be specific to your app, so let's talk about them. cb is a callback function. It gets executed when a central connects to your peripheral after receiving an advertisement. The cb_arg argument gets passed to the cb callback. If your callback doesn't need the cb_arg parameter, you can do what bleprph does and pass NULL . Once a connection is established, the cb callback becomes permanently associated with the connection. All subsequent events related to the connection are communicated to your app via calls to this callback function. GAP event callbacks are an important part of building a BLE app, and we examine bleprph 's connection callback in detail in the next section of this tutorial. One final note: Your peripheral automatically stops advertising when a central connects to it. You can immediately resume advertising if you want to allow another central to connect, but you will need to do so explicitly by calling ble_gap_adv_start() again. Also, be aware NimBLE's default configuration only allows a single connection at a time. NimBLE supports multiple concurrent connections, but you must configure it to do so first.","title":"Advertising"},{"location":"os/tutorials/bleprph/bleprph-adv/#ble-peripheral-project","text":"","title":"BLE Peripheral Project"},{"location":"os/tutorials/bleprph/bleprph-adv/#advertising","text":"","title":"Advertising"},{"location":"os/tutorials/bleprph/bleprph-adv/#overview","text":"A peripheral announces its presence to the world by broadcasting advertisements.

Information that doesn't fit neatly into a standard field should be put in the manufacturing specific data field. As you can see in the above code listing, the struct ble_hs_adv_fields instance is allocated on the stack. It is OK to use the stack for this struct and the data it references, as the ble_gap_adv_set_fields() function makes a copy of all the advertisement data before it returns. bleprph doesn't take full advantange of this; it stores its device name in a static array. The code sets several members of the struct ble_hs_adv_fields instance. Most of them are quite straight-forward. However, the name_is_complete field requires some explanation. Bluetooth specifies two name-related advertisement fields: Shortened Local Name and Complete Local Name . Setting the name_is_complete variable to 1 or 0 tells NimBLE which of these two fields to include in advertisements. Some other advertisement fields also correspond to multiple variables in the field struct, so it is a good idea to review the ble_hs_adv_fields reference to make sure you get the details right in your app.","title":"Setting advertisement data"},{"location":"os/tutorials/bleprph/bleprph-adv/#begin-advertising","text":"An app starts advertising with ble_gap_adv_start() function. This function allows a lot of flexibility, and it might seem daunting at first glance. bleprph specifies a simple set of arguments that is appropriate for most peripherals. When getting started on a typical peripheral, we recommend you use the same arguments as bleprph , with the exception of the last two ( cb and cb_arg ; bleprph_gap_event and NULL in this case). These last two arguments will be specific to your app, so let's talk about them. cb is a callback function. It gets executed when a central connects to your peripheral after receiving an advertisement. The cb_arg argument gets passed to the cb callback. If your callback doesn't need the cb_arg parameter, you can do what bleprph does and pass NULL . Once a connection is established, the cb callback becomes permanently associated with the connection. All subsequent events related to the connection are communicated to your app via calls to this callback function. GAP event callbacks are an important part of building a BLE app, and we examine bleprph 's connection callback in detail in the next section of this tutorial. One final note: Your peripheral automatically stops advertising when a central connects to it. You can immediately resume advertising if you want to allow another central to connect, but you will need to do so explicitly by calling ble_gap_adv_start() again. Also, be aware NimBLE's default configuration only allows a single connection at a time. NimBLE supports multiple concurrent connections, but you must configure it to do so first.","title":"Begin advertising"},{"location":"os/tutorials/bleprph/bleprph-app/","text":"BLE Peripheral Project Overview Now that we've gone through how BLE Apps are contructed, how they function, and how all the parts fit together let's try out a BLE Peripheral App to see how it all works.

Recall that services and characteristics are registered with NimBLE via attribute tables. Each characteristic definition in an attribute table contains an access_cb field. The access_cb field is an application callback that gets executed whenever a peer device attempts to read or write the characteristic.

Function signature static int gatt_svr_chr_access_alert ( uint16_t conn_handle , uint16_t attr_handle , struct ble_gatt_access_ctxt *ctxt , void *arg ) A characteristic access function always takes this same set of parameters and always returns an int. The parameters to this function type are documented below. Parameter Purpose Notes conn_handle Indicates which connection the characteristic access was sent over. Use this value to determine which peer is accessing the characteristic. attr_handle The low-level ATT handle of the characteristic value attribute. Can be used to determine which characteristic is being accessed if you don't want to perform a UUID lookup. op Indicates whether this is a read or write operation Valid values are: BLE_GATT_ACCESS_OP_READ_CHR BLE_GATT_ACCESS_OP_WRITE_CHR ctxt Contains the characteristic value mbuf that the application needs to access. For characteristic accesses, use the ctxt->chr member; for descriptor accesses, use the ctxt->dsc member. The return value of the access function tells the NimBLE stack how to respond to the peer performing the operation. A value of 0 indicates success. For failures, the function returns the specific ATT error code that the NimBLE stack should respond with. Note: The return code is a formal code, not a NimBLE value! Determine characteristic being accessed { uint16_t uuid16 ; uuid16 = ble_uuid_128_to_16 ( ctxt->chr->uuid128 ); assert ( uuid16 != 0 ); switch ( uuid16 ) { // [...] This function uses the UUID to determine which characteristic is being accessed. There are two alternative methods bleprph could have used to accomplish this task: Map characteristics to ATT handles during service registration; use the attr_handle parameter as a key into this table during characteristic access. Implement a dedicated function for each characteristic; each function inherently knows which characteristic it corresponds to. All the ANS service characteristics have 16-bit UUIDs, so this function uses the ble_uuid_128_to_16() function to convert the 128-bit UUID to its corresponding 16-bit UUID. This conversion function returns the corresponding 16-bit UUID on success, or 0 on failure. Success is asserted here to ensure the NimBLE stack is doing its job properly; the stack should only call this function for accesses to characteristics that it is registered with, and all ANS service characteristics have valid 16-bit UUIDs. Read access case GATT_SVR_CHR_SUP_NEW_ALERT_CAT_UUID : assert ( ctxt->op == BLE_GATT_ACCESS_OP_READ_CHR ); rc = os_mbuf_append ( ctxt->om , &gatt_svr_new_alert_cat , sizeof gatt_svr_new_alert_cat ); return rc == 0 ? 0 : BLE_ATT_ERR_INSUFFICIENT_RES ; This code excerpt handles read accesses to the Supported New Alert Category characteristic. The assert() here is another case of making sure the NimBLE stack is doing its job; this characteristic was registered as read-only, so the stack should have prevented write accesses. To fulfill a characteristic read request, the application needs fill a buffer ( om ) with the characteristic value. The NimBLE host will then include the contents of this buffer in its read response. NimBLE uses mbufs to exchange data between itself and the application. To fill an mbuf with data that is available in a contiguous chunk of memory, the os_mbuf_append() function suffices. The source of the data, gatt_svr_new_alert_cat , is is stored in read-only memory as follows: static const uint8_t gatt_svr_new_alert_cat = 0x01 ; /* Simple alert. */ It is not shown in the above snippet, but this function ultimately returns 0. By returning 0, bleprph indicates that the characteristic data in ctxt->om is valid and that NimBLE should include it in its response to the peer. Write access static uint16_t gatt_svr_unr_alert_stat ; case GATT_SVR_CHR_UNR_ALERT_STAT_UUID : if ( ctxt->op == BLE_GATT_ACCESS_OP_WRITE_CHR ) { if ( OS_MBUF_PKTLEN ( ctxt->om ) != sizeof gatt_svr_unr_alert_stat ) { return BLE_ATT_ERR_INVALID_ATTR_VALUE_LEN ; } rc = ble_hs_mbuf_to_flat ( ctxt->om , &gatt_svr_unr_alert_stat , sizeof gatt_svr_unr_alert_stat , NULL ); if ( rc != 0 ) { return BLE_ATT_ERR_UNLIKELY ; } return 0 ; } else /* [...] */ This code excerpt handles writes to the New Alert characteristic. For writes, the role of the ctxt->om field is the reverse of the read case. The NimBLE stack uses these fields to indicate the data written by the peer. Many characteristics have strict length requirements for write operations. This characteristic has such a restriction; if the written data is not a 2-byte value, the application tells NimBLE to respond with an invalid attribute value length error. bleprph copies the data out of the supplied mbuf and writes it to a contiguous chunk of storage (the gatt_svr_unr_alert_stat variable). This is accomplished with the ble_hs_mbuf_to_flat() function. If the application did not have a suitable destination for the data handy, it could have inherited the mbuf from the context object. This is done by saving a copy of the mbuf pointer, and assigning NULL to ctxt->om . By assigning NULL to the mbuf pointer, your application prevents the stack from freeing the mbuf while it is still being used. Be aware, however, that it is the application's responsibility to free inherited mbufs.","title":"Characteristic Access"},{"location":"os/tutorials/bleprph/bleprph-chr-access/#ble-peripheral-project","text":"","title":"BLE Peripheral Project"},{"location":"os/tutorials/bleprph/bleprph-chr-access/#characteristic-access","text":"","title":"Characteristic Access"},{"location":"os/tutorials/bleprph/bleprph-chr-access/#review","text":"A characteristic's access callback implements its behavior.

A GAP event callback is a bit of application code which NimBLE uses to inform you of connection-related events. For example, if a connection is terminated, NimBLE lets you know about it with a call to that connection's callback. In the advertising section of this tutorial, we saw how the application specifies a GAP event callback when it begins advertising. NimBLE uses this callback to notify the application that a central has connected to your peripheral after receiving an advertisement. Let's revisit how bleprph specifies its connection callback when advertising: /* Begin advertising. */ memset ( &adv_params , 0 , sizeof adv_params ); adv_params . conn_mode = BLE_GAP_CONN_MODE_UND ; adv_params . disc_mode = BLE_GAP_DISC_MODE_GEN ; rc = ble_gap_adv_start ( BLE_ADDR_TYPE_PUBLIC , 0 , NULL , BLE_HS_FOREVER , &adv_params , bleprph_gap_event , NULL ); if ( rc != 0 ) { BLEPRPH_LOG ( ERROR , \"error enabling advertisement; rc=%d\\n\" , rc ); return ; } bleprph_gap_event() The bleprph_gap_event() function is bleprph 's GAP event callback; NimBLE calls this function when the advertising operation leads to connection establishment. Upon connection establishment, this callback becomes permanently associated with the connection; all subsequent events related to this connection are communicated through this callback.

The set of supported attributes are expressed as a series of tables that resides in your C code. bleprph supports the following services: GAP GATT newtmgr Alert Notification Security Test The first two services (GAP and GATT) are mandatory services that all BLE peripherals must support. These are implemented in a separate package which the bleprph app depends on. Later, we will see how the main() function initializes and registers this package. Your app will follow the same procedure when using GATT service libraries. The third service, newtmgr, is vendor-specific service supported by most Mynewt devices. This service is used for remote configuration, status queries, and firmware updates. As with GAP and GATT, this service is implemented in a package separate from the bleprph app. The final two services, Alert Notification and Security Test , are not implemented in separate libraries. Rather, these services are specific to the app, so they are implemented the bleprph app itself. The attribute table used to express these services is located in the gatt_svr.c file, so let's take a look at that now. The attribute table is called gatt_svr_svcs ; here are the first several lines from this table: static const struct ble_gatt_svc_def gatt_svr_svcs [] = { { /*** Alert Notification Service. */ . type = BLE_GATT_SVC_TYPE_PRIMARY , . uuid128 = BLE_UUID16 ( GATT_SVR_SVC_ALERT_UUID ), . characteristics = ( struct ble_gatt_chr_def []) { { . uuid128 = BLE_UUID16 ( GATT_SVR_CHR_SUP_NEW_ALERT_CAT_UUID ), . access_cb = gatt_svr_chr_access_alert , . flags = BLE_GATT_CHR_F_READ , }, { . uuid128 = BLE_UUID16 ( GATT_SVR_CHR_NEW_ALERT ), . access_cb = gatt_svr_chr_access_alert , . flags = BLE_GATT_CHR_F_NOTIFY , }, { // [...] As you can see, the table is an array of service definitions ( struct ble_gatt_svc_def ). This code excerpt contains a small part of the Alert Notification service. Let's now consider the contents of this table in more detail. A service definition consists of the following fields: Field Meaning Notes type Specifies whether this is a primary or secondary service. Secondary services are not very common. When in doubt, specify BLE_GATT_SVC_TYPE_PRIMARY for new services. uuid128 The 128-bit UUID of this service. If the service has a 16-bit UUID, you can convert it to its corresponding 128-bit UUID with the BLE_UUID16() macro. characteristics The array of characteristics that belong to this service. A service is little more than a container of characteristics; the characteristics themselves are where the real action happens. A characteristic definition consists of the following fields: Field Meaning Notes uuid128 The 128-bit UUID of this characteristic. If the characteristic has a 16-bit UUID, you can convert it to its corresponding 128-bit UUID with the BLE_UUID16() macro. access_cb A callback function that gets executed whenever a peer device accesses this characteristic. For reads: this function generates the value that gets sent back to the peer. For writes: this function receives the written value as an argument. flags Indicates which operations are permitted for this characteristic. The NimBLE stack responds negatively when a peer attempts an unsupported operation. The full list of flags can be found under ble_gatt_chr_flags in net/nimble/host/include/host/ble_gatt.h . A characteristic's access callback implements its behavior. Access callbacks are described in detail in the next section: BLE Peripheral - Characteristic Access . The service definition array and each characteristic definition array is terminated with an empty entry, represented with a 0. The below code listing shows the last service in the array, including terminating zeros for the characteristic array and service array. { /*** Service: Security test. */ . type = BLE_GATT_SVC_TYPE_PRIMARY , . uuid128 = gatt_svr_svc_sec_test_uuid , . characteristics = ( struct ble_gatt_chr_def []) { { /*** Characteristic: Random number generator. */ . uuid128 = gatt_svr_chr_sec_test_rand_uuid , . access_cb = gatt_svr_chr_access_sec_test , . flags = BLE_GATT_CHR_F_READ | BLE_GATT_CHR_F_READ_ENC , }, { /*** Characteristic: Static value. */ . uuid128 = gatt_svr_chr_sec_test_static_uuid , . access_cb = gatt_svr_chr_access_sec_test , . flags = BLE_GATT_CHR_F_READ | BLE_GATT_CHR_F_WRITE | BLE_GATT_CHR_F_WRITE_ENC , }, { 0 , /* No more characteristics in this service. */ } }, }, { 0 , /* No more services. */ }, Registration function After you have created your service table, your app needs to register it with the NimBLE stack. This is done by calling the ble_gatts_add_svcs() function. There is a small complication, though. The NimBLE host needs to allocate sufficient resources upfront to accommodate all of your peripheral's services. You can ensure your GATT services are accounted for in the host configuration object by calling the ble_gatts_count_cfg() function. The bleprph app registers its services in gatt_svr.c as follows: int gatt_svr_init ( struct ble_hs_cfg *cfg ) { int rc ; rc = ble_gatts_count_cfg ( gatt_svr_svcs , cfg ); if ( rc != 0 ) { return rc ; } rc = ble_gatts_add_svcs ( gatt_svr_svcs ); if ( rc != 0 ) { return rc ; } return 0 ; } You application will perform the above two-step process for each service definition array that you wish to register. Libraries that implement GATT services will generally expose an initialization function which does this for you.

What differentiates a repository from a Mynewt project is the presence of a repository.yml file describing the repository. This will be described below. For a basic understanding of repositories you may read the Newt Tool Manual and How to create repos . Note: For the remainder of this document we'll use the term repo as shorthand for a Mynewt repository. Repos are useful because they are an organized way for the community to share Mynewt packages and projects. In fact, the Mynewt-core is distributed as a repo. Why does Mynewt need additional repos? Repos add functionality not included in the Mynewt core. New repos might be created for several reasons. Expertise . Individuals or organizations may have expertise that they want to share in the form of repos. For example a chip vendor may create a repo to hold the Mynewt support for their chips. Non-Core component . Some components, although very useful to Mynewt users are not core to all Mynewt users. These are likely candidates to be held in different repos. Software licensing . Some software have licenses that make them incompatible with the ASF (Apache Software Foundation) license policies. These may be valuable components to some Mynewt users, but cannot be contained in the apache-Mynewt-core . What Repos are in my Project The list of repos used by your project are contained within the project.yml file. An example can be seen by creating a new project: $ mkdir ~/dev $ cd ~/dev $ newt new myproj $ cd myproj View the project.yml section and you will see a line describing the repos: project.repositories: - apache-Mynewt-core By default, this newly created project uses a single repo called apache-Mynewt-core . If you wish to add additional repos, you would add additional lines to the project.repositories variable like this. project.repositories: - apache-Mynewt-core - another_repo_named_x Repo Descriptors In addition to the repo name, the project.yml file must also contain a repo descriptor for each repository you include that gives newt information on obtaining the repo. In the same myproj above you will see the following repo descriptor. repository.apache-Mynewt-core: type: github vers: 1-latest user: apache repo: incubator-mynewt-core A repo descriptor starts with repository.<name>. . In this example, the descriptor specifies the information for the apache-Mynewt-core . The fields within the descriptor have the following definitions: type -- The type of code storage the repo uses. The current version of newt only supports github. Future versions may support generic git or other code storage mechanisms. vers -- The version of the repo to use for your project. A source code repository contains many versions of the source. This field is used to specify the one to use for this project. See the section on versions below for a detailed description of the format of this field. user -- The username for the repo. On github, this is the name after github.com in the repo path. Consider the repository https://github.com/apache/incubator-mynewt-core . It has username apache . repo -- The name of the repo. On github, this is the name after the username described above. Consider the repository https://github.com/apache/incubator-mynewt-core . It has path incubator-mynewt-core . This is a path to the source control and should not be confused with the name of the repo that you used in the repository.<name> declaration above. That name is contained elsewhere within the repo. See Below. Adding Existing Repos to my Project To add a new repo to your project, you have to complete two steps. Edit the project.yml file and add a new repo descriptor. The previous section includes information on the field required in your repo descriptor. Edit the project/yml file and add a new line to the project.repositories variable with the name of the repo you are adding. An example of a project.yml file with two repositories is shown below: project.name: \"my_project\" project.repositories: - apache-Mynewt-core - Mynewt_arduino_zero # Use github's distribution mechanism for core ASF libraries. # This provides mirroring automatically for us. # repository.apache-Mynewt-core: type: github vers: 1-latest user: apache repo: incubator-mynewt-core # a special repo to hold hardware specific stuff for arduino zero repository.Mynewt_arduino_zero: type: github vers: 1-latest user: runtimeco repo: Mynewt_arduino_zero What Version of the Repo to use Mynewt repos are version-ed artifacts. They are stored in source control systems like github. The repo descriptor in your project.yml file must specify the version of the repo you will accept into your project. For now, we are at the beginnings of Mynewt. For testing and evaluation please use 1-latest in the vers field in your repo descriptor. vers:1-latest See Create a Repo for a description of the versioning system and all the possible ways to specify a version to use. Identifying a Repo A repo contains Mynewt packages organized in a specific way and stored in one of the supported code storage methods described above. In other words, it is a Mynewt project with an additional file repository.yml which describes the repo for use by newt (and humans browsing them). It contains a mapping of version numbers to the actual github branches containing the source code. Note that the repository.yml file lives only in the master branch of the git repository. Newt will always fetch this file from the master branch and then use that to determine the actual branch required depending on the version specified in your project.yml file. Special care should be taken to ensure that this file exists only in the master branch. Here is the repository.yml file from the apache-Mynewt-core: repo.name: apache-mynewt-core repo.versions: \"0.0.0\": \"master\" \"0.0.1\": \"master\" \"0.7.9\": \"mynewt_0_8_0_b2_tag\" \"0.8.0\": \"mynewt_0_8_0_tag\" \"0.9.0\": \"mynewt_0_9_0_tag\" \"0.9.9\": \"mynewt_1_0_0_b1_tag\" \"0.9.99\": \"mynewt_1_0_0_b2_tag\" \"0.9.999\": \"mynewt_1_0_0_rc1_tag\" \"1.0.0\": \"mynewt_1_0_0_tag\" \"0-latest\": \"1.0.0\" # 1.0.0 \"0-dev\": \"0.0.0\" # master \"0.8-latest\": \"0.8.0\" \"0.9-latest\": \"0.9.0\" \"1.0-latest\": \"1.0.0\" # 1.0.0 It contains the following: repo.name The external name that is used to include the library in your project.yml file. This is the name you in include in the project.repositories variable when adding this repository to your project. repo.versions A description of what versions to give the user depending on the settings in their project.yml file. Repo Version The repo version number resolves to an actual git branch depending on the mapping specified in repository.yml for that repo. The version field argument in your project.yml file supports multiple formats for flexibility: <major_num>.<minor_num>.<revision_num> or <major_num>.<minor_num>-<stability string> or <major_num>-<stability string> The stability string can be one of 3 pre-defined stability values. stable -- A stable release version of the repository dev -- A development version from the repository latest -- The latest from the repository In your project.yml file you can specify different combinations of the version number and stability value.

It's up to the repository maintainer to map these to branches of the repository. For example, let's say in a fictitious repository the following are defined. repo.versions: \"0.8.0\": \"xxx_branch_0_8_0\" \"1.0.0\": \"xxx_branch_1_0_0\" \"1.0.2\": \"xxx_branch_1_0_2\" \"1.1.1\": \"xxx_branch_1_1_0\" \"1.1.2\": \"xxx_branch_1_1_2\" \"1.2.0\": \"xxx_branch_1_2_0\" \"1.2.1\": \"xxx_branch_1_2_1\" \"1.2-dev\": \"1.2.1\" \"1-dev\": \"1.2-dev\" \"1.2-stable\": \"1.2.0\" \"0-latest\": \"0.8.0\" \"1-latest\": \"1-dev\" .... When the project.yml file asks for 1.2-stable it is resolved to version 1.2.0 (perhaps 1.2.1 is not stable yet), which in turn resolves to a specific branch xxx_branch_1_2_0 . This is the branch that newt fetches into your project. Note: Make sure a repo version exists in the repository.yml file of a repo you wish to add. Otherwise Newt will not be able to resolve the version and will fail to fetch the repo into your project. How to find out what Repos are available for Mynewt components Currently, there is no newt command to locate/search Mynewt package repositories. However, since the newt tool supports only github, searching github by keyword is a satisfactory option until a search tool is created. When searching github, recall that a Mynewt repository must have a repository.yml file in its root directory. If you don't see that file, it's not a Mynewt repository and can't be included in your project via the newt tool. Once you find a repository, the github URL and repository.yml file should give you all the information to add it to your project.yml file.","title":"toc"},{"location":"os/tutorials/repo/add_repos/#adding-repositories-to-your-project","text":"","title":"Adding Repositories to your Project"},{"location":"os/tutorials/repo/add_repos/#what-is-a-repository","text":"A repository is a version-ed Mynewt project, which is a collection of Mynewt packages organized in a specific way for redistribution.

This is the branch that newt will then fetch into the project with that project.yml file. Dependencies on other repos Repositories can also have dependencies on other repositories. These dependencies should be listed out on a per-tag basis. So, for example, if apache-mynewt-core were to depend on sterlys-little-repo, you might have the following directives in the repository.yml: develop.repositories: sterlys-little-repo: type: github vers: 0.8-latest user: sterlinghughes repo: sterlys-little-repo This would tell Newt that for anything that resolves to the develop branch, this repository requires the sterlys-little-repo repository.

Currently, if two repositories have the same name, they will conflict and bad things will happen. When a repository is installed to the repos/ directory, the current version of that repository is written to the project.state file.
