BLE Peripheral App
==================

Overview
~~~~~~~~

Now that we've gone through how BLE Apps are contructed, how they
function, and how all the parts fit together let's try out a BLE
Peripheral App to see how it all works.

Prerequisites
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  You should have a BLE Central App of some sort to connect with. On
   Mac OS or iOS, you can use
   `LightBlue <https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/lightblue-explorer-bluetooth/id557428110?mt=8>`__
   which is a free app to browse and connect to BLE Peripheral devices.

Create a New Target
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can create a new project instead, but this tutorial will simply use
the previously created btshell project and add a new target for the BLE
Peripheral

.. code-block:: console

    $ newt target create myperiph
    Target targets/myperiph successfully created
    $ newt target set myperiph bsp=@apache-mynewt-core/hw/bsp/nordic_pca10040
    Target targets/myperiph successfully set target.bsp to @apache-mynewt-core/hw/bsp/nordic_pca10040
    $ newt target set myperiph app=@apache-mynewt-nimble/apps/bleprph
    Target targets/myperiph successfully set target.app to @apache-mynewt-nimble/apps/bleprph
    $ newt target set myperiph build_profile=optimized
    Target targets/myperiph successfully set target.build_profile to optimized
    $ newt build myperiph
    Building target targets/myperiph
    ...
    Linking ~/dev/nrf52dk/bin/targets/myperiph/app/apps/bleprph/bleprph.elf
    Target successfully built: targets/myperiph
    $ newt create-image myperiph 1.0.0
    App image succesfully generated: ~/dev/nrf52dk/bin/targets/myperiph/app/apps/bleprph/bleprph.img
    $ newt load myperiph
    Loading app image into slot 1

Now if you reset the board, and fire up your BLE Central App, you should
see a new peripheral device called 'nimble-bleprph'.

Now that you can see the device, you can begin to interact with the
advertised service.

Click on the device and you'll establish a connection.

Now that you're connected, you can see the Services that are being
advertised.

Scroll to the bottom and you will see a Read Characteristic, and a
Read/Write Characteristic.

.. figure:: ../../../pics/LightBlue-3.jpg

Just click on the Read Write Characteristic and you will see the
existing value.

Type in a new value.

.. figure:: ../../../pics/LightBlue-5.jpg

   LightBlue

And you will see the new value reflected.

If you still have your console connected, you will be able to see the
connection requests, and pairing, happen on the device as well.

.. code:: console

    261496:[ts=2042937440ssb, mod=64 level=1]

Congratulations! You've just built and connected your first BLE
Peripheral device!
